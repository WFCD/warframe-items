A next step here is being considered to add a completely new Ayatan in the place of 2K Endo to give collectors and Endo hunters something to look forward to.","fixes":""},{"name":"Update 19: The War Within","date":"2016-11-12T04:02:28Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/715768-update-19-the-war-within/","additions":"","changes":"Ayatan Sculptures now show number of socketed Stars when viewed in your Inventory. \nReplaced outdated Mod tips with new tips about the Ayatan system.\nYou can now go to Maroo’s Bazaar even if you have reached your daily trade limit.

was a much smaller game. We had fewer weapons, fewer Warframes, and way fewer Mods. As players continue their Forma journey, there’s often discussions on doing a Quality of Life (QOL) pass to the way things work with our favourite Golden Puzzle Piece.\nWe want your Mastery Rank to be considered when using Forma to establish a baseline power level for your playable characters!\nIf a Mastery Rank 30 player uses a Forma, they won’t have to re-unlock any Abilities (or their Ranks) on a given item! Yes, they’ll still need to level the gear itself to apply another Forma but, depending on your Mastery Rank, you can have access to more (or all) Abilities on your unranked gear! This achieves our goal of keeping Forma essential to build customization, but allowing players with higher Mastery Ranks a more convenient experience.\nRight now, using a Forma on a Warframe (or Archwing/Necramech) requires you to start from 0 when it comes to Abilities you can use. Furthermore, you only get the first Rank of your First ability. Take Valkyr for instance. You install a Forma, and you’re back to only casting unranked Rip Line!\nOur change will make it so your Mastery Rank impacts how much you have unlocked by default on Forma use. Following our Valkyr example, with this change, a Mastery Rank 10 player would have all of her abilities unlocked upon applying a Forma to her, albeit not at their full strength!\nyou know by the time you’ve levelled your Valkyr on Hydron to 10, you unlock Hysteria. We are making your Mastery Rank ‘match’ those milestones, so to speak, with the end goal being a Mastery Rank 30 player can use Forma without ever having to be locked out of Abilities. Simply put, the higher your Mastery Rank, the higher the baseline of your gear when using Forma.\nSorties and Arbitrations now allow Mastery Rank 30+ players that have put at least 1 Forma into their Warframe to bypass the \"Rank 30 Warframe\" requirement.","fixes":""},{"name":"Update 30.7: Nidus Prime & Plague Star","date":"2021-09-08T16:58:55Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1279845-update-307-nidus-prime-plague-star/","additions":"","changes":"Changed the sorting of items on the End Of Mission screen to better reflect importance, including Steel Essence, Riven Slivers, Granum Crowns, Built Forma, Orokin Cells, Corrupted Holokeys, built Prime parts, War Hilt, Requiem Ultimatums, Exilus Adapters, Drop Chance Boosters, Scintillant, and built Railjack Components.","fixes":"Fixed inability to use Stance Forma or Umbra Forma on the Dark Split-Sword.\nFixed being able to equip Umbra Forma to Sisters of Parvos Hound weapons.

We had fewer weapons, fewer Warframes, and way fewer Mods. As players continue their Forma journey, there’s often discussions on doing a Quality of Life (QOL) pass to the way things work with our favourite Golden Puzzle Piece.\nWe want your Mastery Rank to be considered when using Forma to establish a baseline power level for your playable characters!\nIf a Mastery Rank 30 player uses a Forma, they won’t have to re-unlock any Abilities (or their Ranks) on a given item! Yes, they’ll still need to level the gear itself to apply another Forma but, depending on your Mastery Rank, you can have access to more (or all) Abilities on your unranked gear! This achieves our goal of keeping Forma essential to build customization, but allowing players with higher Mastery Ranks a more convenient experience.\nRight now, using a Forma on a Warframe (or Archwing/Necramech) requires you to start from 0 when it comes to Abilities you can use. Furthermore, you only get the first Rank of your First ability. Take Valkyr for instance. You install a Forma, and you’re back to only casting unranked Rip Line!\nOur change will make it so your Mastery Rank impacts how much you have unlocked by default on Forma use. Following our Valkyr example, with this change, a Mastery Rank 10 player would have all of her abilities unlocked upon applying a Forma to her, albeit not at their full strength!\nyou know by the time you’ve levelled your Valkyr on Hydron to 10, you unlock Hysteria. We are making your Mastery Rank ‘match’ those milestones, so to speak, with the end goal being a Mastery Rank 30 player can use Forma without ever having to be locked out of Abilities. Simply put, the higher your Mastery Rank, the higher the baseline of your gear when using Forma.\nSorties and Arbitrations now allow Mastery Rank 30+ players that have put at least 1 Forma into their Warframe to bypass the \"Rank 30 Warframe\" requirement.","fixes":""},{"name":"Update 30.7: Nidus Prime & Plague Star","date":"2021-09-08T16:58:55Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1279845-update-307-nidus-prime-plague-star/","additions":"","changes":"Changed the sorting of items on the End Of Mission screen to better reflect importance, including Steel Essence, Riven Slivers, Granum Crowns, Built Forma, Orokin Cells, Corrupted Holokeys, built Prime parts, War Hilt, Requiem Ultimatums, Exilus Adapters, Drop Chance Boosters, Scintillant, and built Railjack Components.","fixes":"Fixed inability to use Stance Forma or Umbra Forma on the Dark Split-Sword.\nFixed being able to equip Umbra Forma to Sisters of Parvos Hound weapons.

The Sisters of Parvos update will bring your own personal Corpus adversary to the Origin System. Those acquainted with the Kuva Lich system will find familiarity with the Sisters of Parvos, but with a full Corpus experience!\nFirst, one must not have an active Kuva Lich, meaning a Kuva Lich and Sister cannot actively be hunting you at the same time \nit’s one or the other! Once you are free from the grips of your Kuva Lich (the process is faster now, see below) it’s time to enter The Granum Void!\nOnce back in your Orbiter, the Sisters name is revealed and takes over the pre-existing Kuva Lich screen to display all her attributes, abilities, AND her trusty Hound. New to the Lich system these Hounds serve as the Sisters personal assassin, tasked with making your life difficult within the Sisters influenced Sector.\nYour Sister then begins her reign over the Star Chat by influencing nodes as her own, but she won’t let you walk into her Sector easily. To help with matchmaking, we have made influence nodes consistent across all Lich and Sister levels. Venus is where Sisters of Parvos start at Rank 1! Once in an influenced node, the Sister’s Hound is released! While these Hounds pose a much harder battle than Kuva Lich Thralls, the Murmur progress is significantly greater. In addition, Hound Mercy Kills can award you Requiem Relics! As a typical Corpus, your Sister will steal any earned Credits from the mission.\nAs you continue fighting the Sister’s Hound on influenced nodes the chance of having your Sister spawn in the mission increases. The process of testing the Requiem order on your Sister is similar to Kuva Liches as failure levels her up, but instead of providing Kuva you and your squadmates can earn between 5K-10K Credits per Requiem attempt.\nBe on the lookout for Kuva Larvlings with the following new weapons:\n1) Rank 1 Kuva Liches appear on Earth\n2) Rank 2 Kuva Liches appear on Mars\n3) Rank 3 Kuva Liches appear on Ceres\n4) Rank 4 Kuva Liches appear on Sedna\n5) Rank 5 Kuva Liches appear on the Kuva Fortress\nEarn this new Requiem as a 25% drop chance when your Kuva Lich or Sister of Parvos flees after you’ve used the correct Requiem Sequence. *This Requiem only drops for the person whose Lich/Sister is downed.\nEarn this Requiem Ultimatum as a 25% drop chance when choosing to either Convert or Vanquish your Kuva Lich or Sister of Parvos. *This Requiem only drops for the person whose Lich/Sister is downed.\nBetween reducing the required Murmurs, adding OULL, adding Requiem Ultimatums, and having this new flow, we have shortened the Kuva Lich cycle and added more control for all Tenno! The final fight is now on your terms, and we hope you enjoy the efforts to improve and simplify this system!\nThroughout our boss design history, we have added things like diminishing returns and damage mitigation techniques like armor or damage attenuation. In the time since we’ve launched the Kuva Liches, we’ve made adjustments to how we handle player damage vs. Liches. We’ve done things like add allowing Status Effects and attenuate damage to try and create a balanced combat experience. Like many bosses in Warframe, Liches have some damage modifiers applied to them.\nWe found a bug in the damage attenuation code, and have fixed it and polished the attenuation for Kuva Liches.\nThis system generally targets the scenario of very high damage things like the Void Rig’s Arquebex vs. a Kuva Lich, a scenario that is now possible due to the final showdown being based in Railjack. When we were testing this Voidrig Vs Lichout, our Liches barely lasted a second and we realized the damage attenuation code could use some review! We found bugs to fix and things to tweak to account for these new scenarios. Our only intention is to give you a fight that lasts more than mere seconds \nIf you do not have any Kuva Lich or Sisters of Parvos history in your Codex, a pop-up message will appear to tell you that you have not encountered any. \nAdded new Kuva Lich transmissions for the following scenarios:\nFixed failing Requiem Mods sequence affecting the appearance of other players’ Kuva Liches.\nFixed holding the Parazon as if it was a sidearm if a Host migration occurred during the Kuva Lich Parazon stab animation.\nFixed instances where Parazon would become invisible or not animating during Kuva Lich attempts. \nFixed getting stuck in other players' Kuva Lich stab cinematics.\nWe are indeed touching 1 non-Melee item in the series of Nerfs, and likely to no one’s surprise it’s the Kuva Nukor. It’s a dominant Secondary with incredible power, which is warranted given its acquisition. It’ll keep all of its signature behaviour, but the general output is being notched down slightly with the following change:\nAfter the original publication of our Dev Workshop, we observed and noted that the Vermisplicer’s behaviour is very similar to the Kuva Nukor. To this end, we wanted to ensure we were consistent in handling the beam chain weapons in this update.\nAny Player who owns a Kuva Nukor will receive an extra 2 x Built Forma.\nPlayers who have Converted a Kuva lich OR vanquished a Kuva Lich will get OULL, which is a Requiem Wildcard Mod!","fixes":"Fixed harmless script error that could occur after a host migration during a Kuva Lich showdown.\nFixed Kuva Lich not leveling up if you get disconnected from the internet before using Parazon on Lich. \nFixed SMAA with Bloom causing black boxes on Kuva Siphon."},{"name":"Gara Prime: Hotfix 30.3.1","date":"2021-05-25T21:15:21Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1265229-gara-prime-hotfix-3031/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed seeing the option to equip your Kuva Lich with another weapon in the Railjack Crew management screen."},{"name":"Gara Prime: Update 30.3.0","date":"2021-05-25T17:56:49Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1265162-gara-prime-update-3030/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Converted Kuva Liches can now be used as ‘On Call’ Crewmates.\nFixed long Kuva weapon names escaping the bounds of the pop-up when viewing in Crew Equip and Contracts screens. \nFixed an explosive barrel in Rotuma, Kuva Fortress ignoring the room lighting and shining bright like a diamond.\nFixed black boxes appearing in the Kuva Fortress tilesets. \nFixed elemental particle effects on the Kuva Shildeg not matching its shape."},{"name":"Call of the Tempestarii: TennoGen: Update 30.2.0","date":"2021-05-12T19:38:18Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1263575-call-of-the-tempestarii-tennogen-update-3020/","additions":"","changes":"Nidus Kuvael Scrounger Skin by Erneix","fixes":"Fixed Kuva Lich finisher sounds when in Sevagoth’s Shadow."},{"name":"Call of the Tempestarii: Hotfix 30.0.7","date":"2021-04-22T17:58:13Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1260721-call-of-the-tempestarii-hotfix-3007/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed misaligned Kuva Lich Chest Armor on Atlas Prime and Atlas Karst. "},{"name":"Call of the Tempestarii: Hotfix 30.0.6","date":"2021-04-20T19:37:13Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1260376-call-of-the-tempestarii-hotfix-3006/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed progression stopper in the Kuva Fortress tileset if a Client joins the mission after the initial gate is opened."},{"name":"Call of the Tempestarii: Hotfix 30.0.3","date":"2021-04-15T17:35:23Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1259228-call-of-the-tempestarii-hotfix-3003/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed an issue with accounts that created a Kuva Lich using Sevagoth’s Shadow and vanquished a Lich with such a progenitor.

Today, that changes!\nIf you watched Devstream #136, the 2019 Player Survey showed us that out of the 27,000+ responses, the Kuva Lich system was the 2019 addition that was enjoyed the least. Many players voiced that the Kuva Lich system got progressively less fun the more time and energy was devoted to it. While finding the line between repetition and progress is one Warframe has struggled with since it’s first day, Liches highlighted some issues we aim to address while walking that line.\nA downed Kuva Larvling will now display an icon of the Kuva weapon that it’s birthed Kuva Lich will possess!\nThis allows players to decide upfront if they want to pursue that weapon by finishing the downed Kuva Larvling, or to ignore and attempt another Lich. The Kuva Larvling will be in this downed state for a max of 30 seconds before it perishes.\nYour Kuva Lich will no longer kill you when you fail a Requiem guess, nor will they attempt to break your back. The Parazon stabbing animation will play but the UI will show whether it was a success or failure.

The Sisters of Parvos update will bring your own personal Corpus adversary to the Origin System. Those acquainted with the Kuva Lich system will find familiarity with the Sisters of Parvos, but with a full Corpus experience!\nFirst, one must not have an active Kuva Lich, meaning a Kuva Lich and Sister cannot actively be hunting you at the same time \nit’s one or the other! Once you are free from the grips of your Kuva Lich (the process is faster now, see below) it’s time to enter The Granum Void!\nOnce back in your Orbiter, the Sisters name is revealed and takes over the pre-existing Kuva Lich screen to display all her attributes, abilities, AND her trusty Hound. New to the Lich system these Hounds serve as the Sisters personal assassin, tasked with making your life difficult within the Sisters influenced Sector.\nYour Sister then begins her reign over the Star Chat by influencing nodes as her own, but she won’t let you walk into her Sector easily. To help with matchmaking, we have made influence nodes consistent across all Lich and Sister levels. Venus is where Sisters of Parvos start at Rank 1! Once in an influenced node, the Sister’s Hound is released! While these Hounds pose a much harder battle than Kuva Lich Thralls, the Murmur progress is significantly greater. In addition, Hound Mercy Kills can award you Requiem Relics! As a typical Corpus, your Sister will steal any earned Credits from the mission.\nAs you continue fighting the Sister’s Hound on influenced nodes the chance of having your Sister spawn in the mission increases. The process of testing the Requiem order on your Sister is similar to Kuva Liches as failure levels her up, but instead of providing Kuva you and your squadmates can earn between 5K-10K Credits per Requiem attempt.\nBe on the lookout for Kuva Larvlings with the following new weapons:\n1) Rank 1 Kuva Liches appear on Earth\n2) Rank 2 Kuva Liches appear on Mars\n3) Rank 3 Kuva Liches appear on Ceres\n4) Rank 4 Kuva Liches appear on Sedna\n5) Rank 5 Kuva Liches appear on the Kuva Fortress\nEarn this new Requiem as a 25% drop chance when your Kuva Lich or Sister of Parvos flees after you’ve used the correct Requiem Sequence. *This Requiem only drops for the person whose Lich/Sister is downed.\nEarn this Requiem Ultimatum as a 25% drop chance when choosing to either Convert or Vanquish your Kuva Lich or Sister of Parvos. *This Requiem only drops for the person whose Lich/Sister is downed.\nBetween reducing the required Murmurs, adding OULL, adding Requiem Ultimatums, and having this new flow, we have shortened the Kuva Lich cycle and added more control for all Tenno! The final fight is now on your terms, and we hope you enjoy the efforts to improve and simplify this system!\nThroughout our boss design history, we have added things like diminishing returns and damage mitigation techniques like armor or damage attenuation. In the time since we’ve launched the Kuva Liches, we’ve made adjustments to how we handle player damage vs. Liches. We’ve done things like add allowing Status Effects and attenuate damage to try and create a balanced combat experience. Like many bosses in Warframe, Liches have some damage modifiers applied to them.\nWe found a bug in the damage attenuation code, and have fixed it and polished the attenuation for Kuva Liches.\nThis system generally targets the scenario of very high damage things like the Void Rig’s Arquebex vs. a Kuva Lich, a scenario that is now possible due to the final showdown being based in Railjack. When we were testing this Voidrig Vs Lichout, our Liches barely lasted a second and we realized the damage attenuation code could use some review! We found bugs to fix and things to tweak to account for these new scenarios. Our only intention is to give you a fight that lasts more than mere seconds \nIf you do not have any Kuva Lich or Sisters of Parvos history in your Codex, a pop-up message will appear to tell you that you have not encountered any. \nAdded new Kuva Lich transmissions for the following scenarios:\nFixed failing Requiem Mods sequence affecting the appearance of other players’ Kuva Liches.\nFixed holding the Parazon as if it was a sidearm if a Host migration occurred during the Kuva Lich Parazon stab animation.\nFixed instances where Parazon would become invisible or not animating during Kuva Lich attempts. \nFixed getting stuck in other players' Kuva Lich stab cinematics.\nWe are indeed touching 1 non-Melee item in the series of Nerfs, and likely to no one’s surprise it’s the Kuva Nukor.

A copious amount of Additions, Changes, and Fixes have been made in these 3 months; each one of them touching the surface of feedback, but not fully reaching all the way into the depths. Today, that changes!\nIf you watched Devstream #136, the 2019 Player Survey showed us that out of the 27,000+ responses, the Kuva Lich system was the 2019 addition that was enjoyed the least. Many players voiced that the Kuva Lich system got progressively less fun the more time and energy was devoted to it. While finding the line between repetition and progress is one Warframe has struggled with since it’s first day, Liches highlighted some issues we aim to address while walking that line.\nA downed Kuva Larvling will now display an icon of the Kuva weapon that it’s birthed Kuva Lich will possess!\nThis allows players to decide upfront if they want to pursue that weapon by finishing the downed Kuva Larvling, or to ignore and attempt another Lich. The Kuva Larvling will be in this downed state for a max of 30 seconds before it perishes.\nYour Kuva Lich will no longer kill you when you fail a Requiem guess, nor will they attempt to break your back. The Parazon stabbing animation will play but the UI will show whether it was a success or failure. Upon receiving a Requiem fail, your Kuva Lich will laugh at you and leave, leaving your back and dignity intact!\nYour Kuva weapon duplicates now offer a gradual progression towards a “perfect” Kuva weapon, which would reflect a 60% damage value, if you choose to pursue this path.\nAs you can see, we’ve cracked a few eggs to make this omelette! We look forward to your feedback on these Kuva Lich changes!\nIncreased Converted Kuva Lich minimum time to 2 minutes.\nIncreased Converted Kuva Lich Damage Per Second with damage bonus upgrade 3x.\nFixed Converted Kuva Liches not using their abilities.\nDoubled the chance of a Kuva Lich to have a Vengeful Ephemera from 10% to 20%!\nChanged all Kuva Thrall markers to consistently reflect the new icon brought in 27.0.11. This includes the minimap and when waypointing a Kuva Thrall.\nKuva pickup/rewards are now displayed as the fancy banner UI, similar to Argon.\nKuva Liches can no longer be Parazon stabbed as they are escaping. This resulted in invisible animations, and the UI unveiling if your Requiem Mod guess was correct but not registering it, thus not ranking up your Kuva Lich.\nCleaned up visual metal chunks from the Kuva Liches Carapace (Iron Skin) ability.\nYou can now search the Kuva Lich History Codex section by name, Kuva weapon, and Ephemera.\nFixed Nidus Helmet Armor not appearing grayscale on Kuva Liches.\nFixed certain enemy types being allowed to be spawned as Kuva Thralls that shouldn't be.\nFixed cases of the Kuva Lich ping-ponging between locations when engaging its target.\nFixed script error when changing resolution while in the Kuva Lich screen.\nOptimizations for the Kuva Fortress tileset.

Faint memories of the Mandachord orchestra linger, and Suda wishes you follow it. Do as the Cephalon requests and be rewarded knowledge of an instrument from another time, the Mandachord. But, take caution... following her instructions may lead you down a twisted path...\nCompose her song and then conduct the mighty Mandachord, turning bass, beat and melody into an anthem of devastation.\nConduct your very own symphony, Tenno. Octavia’s abilities are powered by the Mandachord, a formidable tool used to mix Melody, Bass, and Percussion into a harmony of destruction. Compose a song before entering the battle by going to your Arsenal, selecting the Appearance tab, and hitting the “Mandachord” button.\nIn this guide, we will be using the Adau Instruments to get you started on composition since they are the default Mandachord Instruments. There are also 4 other Instruments available in the Market for Platinum if you own Octavia:\nThe Mandachord is comprised of 4 bars which are represented by the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 (seen in the background of each bar). Placing one note at the start of each bar is a whole note. Each bar is divided into quarters which are represented by the vertical lines. The tempo is set to 120 beats per minute, meaning each bar is 2 seconds long, and each slot is a 16th note.\nYou will notice the pitch rises as you move towards the outer ring of the Mandachord. Each Instrument works this way, enabling your notes to sound at the same pitch with different Instruments. Other Instruments have different bass-only sounds for this section as well, so feel free to experiment.\nUse “Load Song” to select one of your custom songs or one of the default Instrument songs to load into the Mandachord.\nOnce you have selected a song to share, a link with its title will appear in chat for others to save. Clicking on a song link will give you the following instructions on how to load the song into your own Mandachord:\nOnce you have the song loaded into your Mandachord, you are free to edit it. You can also save shared songs, but keep in mind the 5 song slot limit.\nThe Relays and Maroo’s Bazaar now offer dedicated music zones, where you can share your Mandachord compositions and boogie down with fellow Tenno. Simply bring Octavia to one of the areas marked with the symbol seen in the image below, and select any of the Narta emotes listed above to start the party.\nDojos have a “free for all” policy when it comes to sharing your Mandachord compositions. Team up with your Clan to create symphonies in the comfort of your own Dojo, without concern of getting a noise complaint.","fixes":""}],"skipBuildTimePrice":25,"tradable":false,"type":"Key","uniqueName":"/Lotus/Types/Keys/BardQuest/BardQuestSequencerItem"},{"category":"Misc","description":"A crucial component

We did this to connect Railjack to some more ‘core Warframe’ style rewards, and make their acquisition more straightforward for matchmaking purposes.\nWith new Proxima regions unveiled come new Railjack enemies of the Corpus variety! Corpus Proximas are loaded with special units engineered to withstand the outer limits of the Star Chart, and also bring you down.\nArm your Railjack to fend off HARPI attack fighters armed with rapid-fire plasma cannons, WEAVER fighters who spin and launch target-seeking globes of highly-charged plasma, BASILISK fighters with tracking turrets that deliver focused bursts from its energy beam, and many more!\nWe are removing 6 Railjack Resources from drop tables:\nWe wanted to reduce the number of Resources we introduced in our original Railjack launch. They'll remain in your Inventory as we’ll be looking at possibly reintroducing them at a later date. All Blueprints that required these items have been updated to reflect viable Resources, and respective drops have been swapped to Ticor Plate where appropriate. These Resources have also been removed from Helminths Bile Feeding menu. If you spot any mentions of these Resources that we might have missed please let us know!\nWith ‘Auto Omni’ and ‘Cordon’ as default Precepts, this Sentinel is the ideal companion for long voyages aboard a Railjack.\nFind Nautilus in the Market for Platinum or its Blueprint/Components in Corpus Railjack Ice Mines!\nNautilus has 100% chance to repair nearby Railjack Hull damages and extinguishes fires on Railjack. Cooldown: 20s\nEnter Railjack. Technology from the Old War that when wielded today, could take all of Warframe’s combat to Orbit. We tried many things that were different from the norm. While some elements did offer a unique spin on the existing formula, it was not for everybody, and many complaints cited the amount of separation from the main game as a negative. And we agree. To quote the venerable Cephalon Cy: We have work to do.\nWhat is ‘The New Railjack’? The name is deceivingly simple. The depth will be explored in this workshop below, indexed by the way you will interact with it.\nNew Railjack Component: Plating\nFirst thing’s first: if you have yet to build your Railjack as part of the Rising Tide Quest, the cost of ship components and the time it takes for each one to build has been dramatically reduced (the difference in cost will be part of our early adopter compensation below). Simply put: less Grind.\nIf you’d rather just jump straight into the action, a fully built Railjack will also be available through the in-game Market for Platinum in the new Railjack category (must have an Archwing to purchase). The Rising Tide Quest will automatically be completed if a Railjack is purchased from the in-game Market \nFor those who prefer the free path, they can enjoy a shorter wait and less Resources to build their own Railjack!\nThat’s right, Avionics are no more. This entire system has been completely overhauled, including Avionics being turned into regular Mods, so everything has been unequipped and reset. Gone are the days of upgradeable Grid slots, and praying that your Host’s Railjack has the Avionics you want to use. In fact, you aren’t even equipping things on the Railjack itself anymore…\nYou will also gain Mastery with your Plexus from Affinity gained in your Railjack missions, which will let you Forma the Plexus to its maximum potential!\nRailjack Mod drains have been rebalanced with respect to the new PLEXUS Modding system.\nRailjack Intrinsics 2.0 Feedback Megathread: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1253290-update-29100-railjack-intrinsics-20-feedback-megathread-read-first-post/\nThe newest and long awaited Command Intrinsic makes its debut! Command brings a whole new gameplay choice to Railjack by giving you the option to Hire your own Crew to operate familiar Railjack tasks: Piloting, Gunnery, Repair, and Combat! For those that want to Solo venture out in space, Hiring a Crew member can help you manage all the aspects of surviving and thriving out in the Proximas.\nOnce you’ve Hired a Crew member from Ticker, head back to your Dry Dock management screen and visit the new Crew tab to ‘ASSIGN CREW’ for your Railjack.\nAdditionally, once you reach Command Rank 8, Converted Kuva Liches are available for Crewing your Railjack as a Defensive powerhouse who are very difficult to take down thanks to their incredibly high Health stat. Their role is strictly to guard your Railjack from intruders while you and your Crew get the rest done! Kuva Lich Crew members come as they are and cannot be Trained or Customized. If you Trade your equipped Converted Kuva Lich Crew member it will be removed from your Crew.\nAnd there you have it! You and your new Railjack Crew are ready for the Proximas!\nNew Railjack Component: Plating\nEven though Mods have been moved to a personal player level, the Components of your Railjack like Shields, Engines and Weapons (Armaments and Components) will still be dependent on the hosting player’s collection. This Update includes a number of new weapons to collect and upgrade (listed below), but also an entirely new component: Plating. Since Health and Armor Mods can no longer be applied to the Railjack itself, this component determines the Health and Armor values of your Railjack.\nThese new Plating Components can be found as Wreckage throughout Grineer & Corpus Railjack missions and can be Repaired and Valence Fusioned like all other Railjack Components in a Dry Dock.\nIn recognition of the construction of a home for the Railjack, and Cephalon Cy.\nThe Exclusive Clan Railjack Monument is available to any Clan that has either built a Dry Dock, or has started research on any of the Railjack Clan Tech to catch Clans who might have removed their Dry Dock at some point.\nBonus Railjack Mods\nRailjack Resource Bundle\nRailjack Resource Bundle #2\nRailjack Resource Bundle #3\nNew Railjack Layout\nWhen you first step onto your Railjack, you may notice a few key differences…\nPilots CAN fire their gun while Boosting at the cost of the Railjack slowing down, as opposed to a hard stop previously mentioned in our Dev Workshop, at which Boosting will resume once firing is over. We’ve added a small cooldown to the Dodge maneuver to compensate for the sprint bar removal, but it can still be used much more frequently than before!\nFinally, we are adding a new craftable: Hull Restore! Forging these instantly restores Health to your Hull in real-time. In this new item and all other Forge craftables, the new resource Ticor Plate (that drops in all Railjack missions) will be essential in keeping your Railjack running smoothly!\nWe have also done a balance pass on various Railjack Mods, some Battle Mods included. Please refer to the specific “RAILJACK BATTLE MOD CHANGES” section of the notes for more details!\nlet’s talk about Reactors. They existed to give you Avionics Capacity, and Flux Energy. Both of those things are now removed, so the new role of Reactors is to provide Power Strength, Range, or Duration buffs to Railjack Battle Avionics being used aboard the ship!\nRailjack Malfunctions/Hazards have also received a refresher to no longer directly affect the Railjacks Health or Shields!\nIce Hazards can now freeze interactive elements of the Railjack: Pilot seat, Forges, Archwing Slingshot, Doors, and Turrets.\nRailjack combat inherited a lot of the familiar Warframe damage types, but with a twist. Impact became Ballistic, Cold became Frost, and so on. We are removing the second layer of ‘Railjack’ Damage types to unify and have the system be based on what Players already spend time learning: core Warframe elements. This means that:\nThe Nodes in the Railjack you know are split across Earth, Saturn, and the Veil Proxima. There’s choice, sure, but there’s no real meaningful choice with the only option being ‘Skirmish’ \nIt comes down to too much repetition of a small set of nodes, and a lot of Railjack just being ignored. For what we believe to be the healthier new direction for Railjack, we are making some changes by removing some existing Grineer nodes.\nThis includes the removal of the Gian Point node. A decision that was not made lightly, but in the interest of improving the variety of missions played we felt it was a necessary step. We’ve essentially taken what was good about Gian Point (a quick turnaround mission with a high Affinity reward) and put it into the objectives of Railjack itself, so that the diversity of content gets played in more than just one node over and over (and over) again.\nThe Corpus Proxima brings a whole new threat that requires all new firepower! These 4 new Railjack Armaments can be found as Wreckage from Corpus Railjack enemies.\nWe have received a lot of feedback on Railjack weapons since it’s release, and as a result, we have made some changes based both on effectiveness and feel. Overall, Railjack Armaments have received a buff to their Damage to better represent cutting through swathes of fighters, much like you would enemies on the ground. Some Armaments have had their accuracy or recoil altered (such as the Apoc Autocannon and Carcinnox) to make them have a more visually ‘cinematic’ effect of spaceship cannons, while maintaining their deadliness.\nThe Railjack is the pinnacle of Old War space combat technology, and we wanted these changes to better reflect that power.\nIncreased the recoil of the Railjack Apoc Autocannons.\nTethered enemies take additional damage from Railjack weapons.\nTether trivialized a lot of the Railjack gameplay flow with how lethal it was toward Fighter units in one-size-fits-all bursts. We want to justify the changes to Tether in the scope of adding new content. Tether would continue to trivialize all phases of Railjack fighter content, so we have made changes to make it more phase-based while still rewarding tactical placement. \nPhoenix Blaze (previously Fiery Phoenix): Railjack weapons gain additional Heat Damage when this ability is active.\nAs mentioned in the ‘LIST OF SCRIPTS’ section above, all Avionics have been converted into Railjack Mods. Retired Railjack Mods have been converted to their new replacements, with Endo given for the ones removed outright. The Endo return totals the amount of Endo spent on these (now) Mods and the dissolve amount based on their rarity.\nFind these new Railjack Integrated Mods as drops from various Corpus and Grineer Railjack enemies.\nFind these new Railjack Integrated Aura Mods as drops from various Corpus and Grineer Railjack enemies.\nNew Railjack Equipment Feedback Megathread: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1253288-update-29100-new-railjack-equipment-feedback-megathread-read-first-post/\nAdded tutorial pop-ups when using the Plexus, Intrinsics, Railjack Star Chart, and Dry Dock for the first time.\nIgnis Wraith Blueprint has been added to Grineer Railjack missions as Point of Interest rewards!\nSelecting the Dry Dock node in the Railjack Navigation menu while in your Orbiter will now take the player directly to their Dry Dock, instead of the default spawn point in your Dojo. \nRailjack fighter spawning mechanics have been adjusted so enemies will now spawn in smaller, spread out groups to allow for a more engaging Railjack experience.\nOftentimes the Railjack fighter spawning logic would result in a large, tight cluster of enemies spawning at the same time that were easy to take out with a single hit (Tether, etc).  \nNew Railjack boost and boost stop sounds have been added!\nSince Avionics are now Railjack Mods you can simply purchase Endo bundles in its place if desired.\nAdded ‘Next Power’ and ‘Use Selected Power’ in the Railjack Key Binding options (found under Options > Controls > Railjack > Customize Key Bindings). \nUpdated Railjack weapon projectiles, trails, hit effects and muzzle FX for improved visibility/impact.\nAs per player feedback, equipped Railjack weapons and equipment will now appear with an ‘equipped’ banner in the Scrapping Wreckage window and will not allow you to Scrap said item.\nRemoved unused ‘preview’ option from the Railjack Scrap Wreckage screens. \nUpdated the Railjack icons in the Railjack Configuration for Components, Armaments, and Upgrade to better resemble what they are. \nFixed a crash as Client during Railjack missions. \nFixed Intrinsic gained not updating locally for Clients when returning to the Dry Dock from a Railjack mission.\nFixed Railjack not appearing in the Dry Dock if you’re a Client in another Dojo and accept an invitation to a squad where the Host is in their Dojo.

As we iterated on the feedback gathered, we wanted to show this in our update notes: if we iterated on a change following feedback, we have listed the original planned change with strike-through for the sake of comparison! The notes that follow are the Dev implementation of that feedback, which are now live! Whether you participated in the Public Test Cluster or shared your thoughts on the Dev Workshop, thank you again for providing thoughtful feedback on these Railjack changes prior to release, we look forward to more opportunities to do the same.\nDoubled the Railjack’s innate loot-pickup (Vacuum) Range.\nWe’ve also improved the way that Vacuums pull items towards the player and the Railjack. The maximum amount of time it takes for the pick-up to reach the player should be a little more consistent now (about 0.75 seconds in most cases).\nChanging the pacing and general feel of all Railjack Piloting and movement to be less reliant on the optimal strategy of “Single strafe Boost then Repeat”: \nDoubled the Railjack’s base Speed. \nRemoved unnecessary ability to use the Omni tool outside of Railjack missions.\nRailjack sessions now lock after 5 minutes or if 50% of the Fighters have died \nWhen transitioning between Railjack missions, your Warframe/Operator Health/Shields will be restored as well as any Vazarin instant Revives.\nRailjack Missions now reward more Credits at End of Mission to tie some of the main currencies into the reward structure more heavily. \nDecreased Railjack Shield Recharge delay from 5 to 3 seconds. Shield Recharge delay remains at 5 second based on Public Test results. \nRailjack Weapon heat build up changes:\nRailjack Weapon changes:\nReduced the Health of all on-foot Grineer Railjack enemies by half.\nRemoved scaled damage controllers from all on-foot Grineer Railjack enemies.\nAdded Caps for the amount of simultaneous Railjack Hazards (Fire, Electric, and Breaches).

Made each RJ Hazard type even more, MORE harmful to the Railjack based on Public Test results. \nReduce Railjack Speed and Damage when Railjack is in “Catastrophic Failure” mode. \nEnemies now spawn much closer to the Railjack vs. 1000+ km away. \nAdded ‘Incomplete’ tab/category to the Avionics screen in the ‘Configure Railjack’ panel, Mods Segment screen, and the Codex.  \nVortex is now attached to the front of your Railjack\nPreviously the only reason you would have upgraded this avionic was to handle more Hazards at once, but now your Railjack can only have 1 Hazard at a time.

First of all, a bit of trivia, Railjack operates at a different scale than the rest of Warframe. Perhaps some of you have seen space-time breaking down in the form of truly enormous cats... The Speed that was being shown in the drydock in your ship Stats was in the wrong scale and gave numbers that were inaccurate.  This also caused the bonus given by your engine, displayed in kilometers-per-hour, to be wrong: an engine might say that it gave an extra 30km per hour, but give far far more than that in the Stats if you did the math to convert.  This has been fixed so that: 1) your Stats now show the correct Speed for Railjack's world scale, and, 2) your engines are rated in meters per second which matches up to the Stats.  While it may look like your ship's Speed stat in the drydock has gone down significantly, please try flying around in missions and see how your ship handles. This only fixes how the UI reports the numbers in your Stats. No change to how fast your ship actually moves is intended, and if your ship doesn't fly at the meters-per-second shown in the Stats then it should be carefully measured and reported as a bug.\nFixed the Railjack Forward Artillery not damaging Crewships past their engines.

More to come!\nPlayers will now have ~3 seconds of invulnerability when exiting the Railjack or a Point of Interest! \nRepairing a minor Railjack Breach/Fire/Electrical when a Catastrophic Failure breach is active will no longer give Health back to the Railjack.\nThis addresses numerous cases of Railjack invulnerability abuse by manipulating the Catastrophic Failure breach timer. We’re looking at other ways to allow Health on minor Breach repairs/fires/electrical during a Catastrophic Failure without opening the door to this misuse. \nDistance values on Railjack enemies will now be displayed once their name is visible.\nUpgraded art quality for certain Grineer Installations in Railjack missions.\nMade some micro-optimizations to the Railjack HUD.\nFixed being placed outside of the Railjack level when loading into a Railjack mission from your Orbiter as the Operator.\nFixed control settings such as mouse sensitivity being set to non-Railjack settings when a Crewship is destroyed. \nThis was most noticeable when Piloting the Railjack during the Crewship explosion, as sensitivity would abruptly change until the Pilot seat was dismounted.\nFixed cases of Armament Wreckage unique stats not showing. This was due to the physical Armament not being equipped on the side of the Railjack, which then considered it not equipped.\nFixed the Munition Ammo count UI in the Railjack displaying 1 more capacity than you actually have (ie 30/31).\nFixed Railjack Forge not applying yield multipliers (Engineer Intrinsic bonus) to displayed craft amounts.\nFixes towards Ram Sleds occurring during a transition to the Dojo after completing a Railjack mission.\nFixed hazard markers (Fire, Electricity, Fast Travel) inside the Railjack appearing in the wrong locations when viewed in the Tactical Menu while on the Pilot seat or side Turrets.\nFixed missing Railjack enemy UI after exiting/returning/exiting the Railjack.\nFixed incorrect minimap overlay when failing a Railjack mission and returning to the Dojo.\nFixed Railjack enemies displaying a Rank of 00.\nFixed a crash while transitioning levels in the Railjack.\nFixed unlocalized Railjack recall text.","fixes":""},{"name":"Empyrean: Ivara Prime 27.0.9","date":"2020-01-09T16:43:11Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1160497-empyrean-ivara-prime-2709/","additions":"","changes":"Our intent is to make Railjack weapons more effective on their own.

You may notice no callout at all, which means the Tactical Menu is not bound to anything and you must bind it first.\nFixed max ranked Battle Forge Railjack Avionic trying to subtract 3.4E+38 seconds (more than the age of the universe) from remaining Forge cooldown time.\nFixed Railjack Engines and Reactors displaying as equipped on the wrong part of the Railjack (Engines on Wing Turrets, etc).\nFixed an unhackable console in a Grineer Galleon Railjack base\nFixed End of Mission screen popping up and 2nd mission not starting when you fail a mission in Railjack, return to Dry Dock, and then try to start another mission.\nFixed a crash related to Railjack encounters activating during a Host migration.\nFixed some Railjack interior textures appearing more ‘Wear & Tear’ than others.","fixes":""},{"name":"Empyrean: Ivara Prime 27.0.6.1","date":"2019-12-18T22:54:11Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1154608-empyrean-ivara-prime-27061/","additions":"","changes":"The Railjack name text now has its own separate color slot in the ‘Primary Text Color’.\nOptimizations towards performance when Piloting the Railjack.\nRamsleds have been given an upgrade the farther you progress into the Railjack Star Chart!

Hull Breaches are represented in the minimap as red flame icons as opposed to normal fires which are orange. A Hull Breach is serious business, and Cy isn’t messing around when he says that critical failure is imminent. Once fires and Hull Breaches have been fully extinguished the Railjacks Health will be restored!

In practice, the actual dependency on RNG and Eximus spawning is gone. You will have a stable, matchmaking friendly way to reliably earn Steel Essence in shorter intervals across more content.","fixes":"The Steel Path provides Tenno with two things: a more difficult journey on the Star Chart, and a new economy with Steel Essence to get some gear.\nWe have decided to revisit the Steel Essence acquisition because at present time, people feel forced to play extremely long macro-based runs to optimize their runs. We would rather try something else.\nEvery day, five Steel Path missions will be chosen randomly, and completing them will award 3 Steel Essence per Incursion. Furthermore, this will unlock the node, even if you have not reached that part of the Steel Path yet! This should help improve the matchmaking situation, among other things.\ndefeating the Acolyte grants a guaranteed drop of 2 Steel Essence. Beware! If you get downed by an Acolyte, they’ll escape and you won’t receive any Steel Essence! \nIn essence (ha), there is virtually no RNG with Steel Essence anymore.
