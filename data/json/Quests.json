Our ambitions to have Replay on launch didn’t make it in time, but we made it our top priority to have it ready for our first Update of 2022. There’s still no accurate words to describe our appreciation for all the support and reactions to The New War, and we hope you enjoy replaying it as many times as you wish!\nExperience The New War Quest once more, Tenno! Access The New War Quest in the Codex to Replay. Please note with this implementation the Replay is a full time commitment and you will be locked into the Quest as you were in the first run, so plan accordingly.\nThis quest has significant Spoilers for Warframe and its future. While The New War has been out since December 15th, there are still Tenno out there who have yet to experience it for the first time. Please let all Tenno experience it at their own pace, and be kind. Use liberal spoiler tags if you wish to talk about it, and do not ruin the experience for someone else. Content Creators should clearly label spoiler content and use spoiler-free thumbnails.\nAdditionally, 3 ‘The New War’ Somachord Tones have been added to the post-New War Plains of Eidolon and Orb Vallis. Based on player feedback, we have made these Somachord Tones stationary, meaning they will always be in the same spot (different from the original Orb Vallis Somachord Tones) and require 1 scan each. They’ll remain in their spots after Scanned for helpful Tenno who waypoint them for others!\nOur TennoBaum celebrations look a little different this year! Due to factors including The New War’s December launch, we have opted to merge this year’s TennoBaum & Star Days together in the month of February.\nWe rebuilt reflections across the entire game when Enhanced Graphics Engine is enabled to use modern high quality texture format which improves the quality and punch of gold, bronze, chrome, and other metallics. This change reduces the noise, makes them more vibrant, and ultimately more balanced overall.

Old enemies have returned to the Origin System… will the factions unite against Ballas, Erra, and the advancing Sentients, or will they buckle under the weight of a full-scale invasion?\nPlayers can prepare for The New War quest in the following ways:\nWe have renamed the former “The New War’ Codex section to “Prelude to War”, players must have this complete to participate in The New War Quest. \nThe New War will take several hours to complete and will prevent normal Warframe activities from taking place for the duration of the quest. Plan accordingly!\nYou may notice your Operator sounds a bit different while playing The New War Quest. We hope you enjoy the updated Operator voices. Pre and Post-New War Operator voices will be the familiar ones you’re accustomed to.\nAdditionally, a new Accessibility setting has been added titled 'Hold Button for Struggle Action'. This allows you to choose either 'Hold' or 'Tap' when confronted with a struggle context action, where typically mashing of a button would be requested. We recommend that you put this setting to your preference before initiating The New War Quest to ensure you have the best experience. Players can turn this on in the Controls options menu at any time in the quest, just above the Archwing section.\nA significant amount of effort has gone into leveraging new graphics technologies for the levels seen in The New War. For PC players we recommend that you set your Graphics Mode to Enhanced for the full experience, if your computer can handle it! (Display tab under Options). The Playstation 5 and XBOX Series X already use this setting.\n*Caliban's base Blueprint can be found in the Market with his Component Blueprints acquired via new Bounty missions unlocked after the completion of the New War Quest. Caliban’s Prex Card can also be found after completion of The New War Quest at a new location.\nCaliban Component Blueprints can be acquired from Narmer Bounties during daylight hours on the Plains of Eidolon, and Orb Vallis during the Night cycle (Night in Cetus means the Bounty is available in Orb Vallis). Narmer Bounties become available after completing The New War quest.\nA new Resource, New Set Mods, a new Amp, and Weapon Blueprints are available in Bounties to those who have completed The New War Quest. This new Resource can also be redeemed for Standing where applicable. \nPrime Resurgence is our first stab at a larger scale Event to the Vaulting program in lieu of The New War.
