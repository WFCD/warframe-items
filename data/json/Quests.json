Regarding Nitain specifically, the majority of our recently active players have less than 9 Nitain in their accounts and there is considerable interest in some new ways to acquire, so we are trying out Sorties as an option.

An inbox message will automatically appear once you have done so.\nOnce you've progressed far enough in The War Within to discover The Kuva Fortress, a new region will appear on your Solar Chart!\nAfter you complete The War Within, Kuva Siphons may appear on Hard Grineer Environments (Sedna, Kuva Fortress, Uranus). These are side-quests related to the larger goals of the Grineer Empire. You will encounter new enemies here, and be required to use the skills learned in The War Within to prevail.\nFourth and fifth weapons existâ¦ but defeating The War Within will be necessary to discover them.\nA Mastery Rank 23 test has been added! The War Within introduces enough content to push long-term players that are currently Mastery Rank 22 into Mastery Rank 23!Â ",
        "changes": "Warframe Update 19: The War Within:\nThe War Within is here on PC! This is the next chapter in the story of Warframe. What we set out to do always seems a little wild in hindsight, but it's the thrill and ambition of storytelling that drives us to challenge ourselves and you. We want to grow and change Warframe in interesting ways. We're presenting you another chapter of growth today.\nThe War Within is also a reflection of lessons for us on how to feed, respect, and tame the growing animal that is Warframe. This update's name has outgrown itself and it represents something bigger. If you asked any of us 4 years ago what we expected to happen with this project, none of us would believe you if you showed us this day.\nEver since the change to the new Solar Chart in Specters of the Rail, the Invasion system hasn't exactly been exciting or novel. The War Within brings some much needed freshness to this part of the game!\nSorties were introduced in The Second Dream. They originally launched with 'Seasons' that rotated with set rewards. Since launch we iterated in several ways, including adding repeatable/non-repeatable rewards and more. Now we bring you more change with The War Within: Sortie Seasons are no more. We now have a set reward list of rewards that are always repeatable.\nThe new pre-requisite to access Sorties is completion of The War Within.Â \nThere is a new addition to Sortie rewards, but this will be revealed upon completion of The War Within.\nVolumetric Lighting technology is here and has been implemented in The War Within quest!",

Separate this Tenno from the flock and it should be easy to kill.
