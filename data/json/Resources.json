We discussed it yesterday, and realized the Scintillant description was too vague in terms of other methods to acquire it and updated its description in the last Hotfix. Overnight, we ran stats and the amount collected was too low, which is widely accepted from the community to be the case. While we all start with baseline ‘0’ for new Updates, this Resource is an outlier in how slowly it’s being accrued, which is to say current pacing not our intention. They should feel like a revised Cetus Wisp, but when we compared the two overnight, and considering more people are playing Heart of Deimos and how many Scintillant are needed, they were lower to a degree that doesn’t make sense with their hookup. Here is how we are fixing that today:\nIsolation Bounty Necramech’s now have a chance to drop Scintillant.\nFixed issues with unable to pick up Scintillant within the Vault environments. \nIncreased the spawn chance and spawn radius size of Scintillant within Vault environments. \nRemoved Scintillant as one of the Weapons Entrati members ‘Parts Requisition’ Tasks.\nAdded a slight glow effect to the Scintillant to increase visibility.\nIncreased the audio loop sound effect when a Scintillant is nearby.\nTransferring into a Necramech and then standing around waiting for it to die to drop rewards is far from the intentions of the Necramech system. We understand this is a frustrating oversight. Additionally, this was often bugged that only 1 person got the drop at all. Enemy Necramechs in the Isolation Vaults will still drop rewards, and now they’ll drop more of them (Scintillant). ","fixes":""},{"name":"Heart of Deimos: Hotfix 29.0.3","date":"2020-08-26T22:57:57Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1217375-heart-of-deimos-hotfix-2903/","additions":"","changes":"Added descriptive text to the Scintillant to expose its secondary acquisition path:","fixes":""}],"tradable":false,"type":"Resource","uniqueName":"/Lotus/Types/Gameplay/InfestedMicroplanet/Resources/EntratiWispItem"},{"category":"Resources","description":"A rare Eidolon Gem, created from the fossilized blood of an ancient Sentient.Location: Plains of Eidolon (Earth) from Blue Mining Veins and Thumper Bulls.
