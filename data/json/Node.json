To do this, you must first reach Venus!\nNew players might only be making their way there now, but with determination and cooperation, you'll master the challenges of the Orb Vallis in no time. We all lift together!\nThe Orb Vallis landscape is so vast in size and discovery that even with the following 20+ pages of notes, this is just the first installment of Fortuna content! You can expect more to come in the next couple of weeks, including more Conservation species, new Operator Amps that will be available for sale from Little Duck’s offerings, and your chance to take down the ultimate threat roaming these terraformed lands. The long awaited Melee 3.0 will also be making its debut in full to accompany the Melee sound additions and changes that were released in Update 23.10.0. A Dev Workshop on the changes will be posted in the future.\nThe best way to catch the robotic 'Servofish' in The Orb Vallis is with The Business' offering of PULSE SPEARS \nYour Ostron Spears will still work in The Orb Vallis, but the fish will be damaged. The key is to catch undamaged fish with the specialized Pulse Spears.\nThere are 13 species of Servofish to be discovered in the various Coolant areas of the Orb Vallis. Some require Baits \nThe Business is equipped with new gear that will allow you to aid in the desperate Conservation effort of The Orb Vallis' wildlife.\nHowzit, glinty? If you’re looking for a new way to traverse the Orb Vallis, the Ventkids have you covered. Hangin’ with their logical fam in the ducts of Fortuna, the Ventkids get by stealing parts from the Corpus and running K-Drive races out on the Vallis.\nWhile you’re grinding your way through Orb Vallis, keep an eye out for Boon, the leader of the Kubrodon Ventkid Gang, who wants to see if your K-Drive skills are up to snuff. Look for Ventkids Icons on your minimap in the Vallis to find various K-Drive Race courses littered throughout the landscape.\nYou can also grind on a variety of surfaces in Orb Vallis!\nGaruda can be acquired via Orb Vallis Bounties & the Vox Solaris Quest, or in the Market for Platinum.",

Fissures now spawn dynamically throughout the level near groups of enemies. The Fissure will corrupt any nearby enemies immediately after spawning. This buffs the enemy, and resets their health/shields. It will also spawn a couple Orokin units along with them, some being Eximus after a certain amount of Fissures. Fissures despawn after a period of time.\nThe corrupted and newly spawned Orokin units have a chance to drop Reactant, which are auto pickups (no more context action). Once you collect enough, you qualify for the Void Projection reward, and one of your weapons or your Warframe will be buffed for a short period of time based on Era of Void Relic brought. You will be given a random amount of Void Trace as well after collecting enough Reactant. Fissures will continue to spawn throughout the mission.",

Our second world is ready: The Orb Vallis.\nEntering The Orb Vallis requires you to first visit Fortuna, a town full of new characters, new content, and new problems to solve! To do this, you must first reach Venus!\nNew players might only be making their way there now, but with determination and cooperation, you'll master the challenges of the Orb Vallis in no time. We all lift together!\nThe Orb Vallis landscape is so vast in size and discovery that even with the following 20+ pages of notes, this is just the first installment of Fortuna content! You can expect more to come in the next couple of weeks, including more Conservation species, new Operator Amps that will be available for sale from Little Duck’s offerings, and your chance to take down the ultimate threat roaming these terraformed lands. The long awaited Melee 3.0 will also be making its debut in full to accompany the Melee sound additions and changes that were released in Update 23.10.0. A Dev Workshop on the changes will be posted in the future.\nThe best way to catch the robotic 'Servofish' in The Orb Vallis is with The Business' offering of PULSE SPEARS \nYour Ostron Spears will still work in The Orb Vallis, but the fish will be damaged. The key is to catch undamaged fish with the specialized Pulse Spears.\nThere are 13 species of Servofish to be discovered in the various Coolant areas of the Orb Vallis. Some require Baits \nThe Business is equipped with new gear that will allow you to aid in the desperate Conservation effort of The Orb Vallis' wildlife.\nHowzit, glinty? If you’re looking for a new way to traverse the Orb Vallis, the Ventkids have you covered. Hangin’ with their logical fam in the ducts of Fortuna, the Ventkids get by stealing parts from the Corpus and running K-Drive races out on the Vallis.\nno Gilding required! You can earn Affinity for your K-Drive by completing tricks in the Vallis.\nWhile you’re grinding your way through Orb Vallis, keep an eye out for Boon, the leader of the Kubrodon Ventkid Gang, who wants to see if your K-Drive skills are up to snuff. Look for Ventkids Icons on your minimap in the Vallis to find various K-Drive Race courses littered throughout the landscape.\nFive K-Drive race courses will be available each day, but you can replay each race for additional Standing until you meet the Standing cap. For those looking for more passive Standing gain, you will earn extra Ventkids Standing for any tricks you complete in the Vallis upon returning to Fortuna.\nKeep an eye out for floating purple K-Drive Trick Boosters that appear while riding out on the Vallis: hit them for an instant boost to your trick score multiplier!\nYou can also grind on a variety of surfaces in Orb Vallis!\nGaruda can be acquired via Orb Vallis Bounties & the Vox Solaris Quest, or in the Market for Platinum.",

Each of the three Archons have received a rework to increase their difficulty level.\nExilus Warframe Adapter \nArchon Shards are a source of anti-entropic radiation ideal for empowering synthetic lifeforms, most notably Archons and Warframes. Managing these Shards is done through Helminth in your Orbiter \nArchon Shards can be socketed in your Warframes to give permanent* additive (do not scale with mods) stat increases.\n*Permanent in the sense that once socketed to your Warframe those stat increases are sustained unless you decide to un-socket it. Read the “How to Use Archon Shards” section to learn more about that.\nEach Archon drops a specific Shard color with different stat categories associated with it. Socket the same color of Archon Shards in your Warframe to focus on one type of combat advantage, or diversify your Shard usage for a more dynamic approach where you feel appropriate.\nOur 50th Warframe STYANAX has arrived! Styanax never wonders how many enemies he will face, only where he can find them.\nFog of War Ephemera\nPart 2 of Round 22 is here! Check them out now via Steam launcher and support hard-working Tenno designers from the Warframe Community.\nStarter Warframe Ability Changes: Excalibur, Mag, & Volt\nWarframe Augment Buffs Part 2\nIn Update 31.2, we buffed a number of underused Warframe augments. The time has come to continue this work! This batch tackles Warframes from Loki to Rhino (of which there are surprisingly many!). We have increased their viability in missions, which we hope will  encourage more build diversity.\nArmor is a fundamental part of Warframe’s balance, but the act of stripping armor has always been somewhat hard to gauge. Currently, when an armor stripping Ability is cast it uses the target’s current armor as the base for its calculation. This means that you may have to cast that Ability several times on the same enemy in order to strip their armor completely.\nArea of Effect (AoE) weapons are a pretty dominant aspect of Warframe gameplay, especially affected by the removal of self-damage a few years ago. We want AoE weapons to feel impactful, but we feel their current state needs adjustment.\nWarframe is a game full of very powerful tactics, but problems arise when players feel ‘forced’ to use specific choices. The top 5 most popular weapons are all AoE, accounting for 47% of all weapon usage at high Mastery Rank AOE usage stats. In situations where efficiency is important, some would say you aren’t playing ‘correctly’ if you’re not utilizing these choices, which some players don’t necessarily find fun.\nIf you are an experienced Warframe player, you are extremely familiar with the Void Fissure mission flow: Select Relic and blitz through enemies to crack it. It is obvious that where Void Fissure missions are, they are far too easy and can be completed with little to no friction (looking at you Lith).

Health Conversion).\nArbitrations now give +500 Health to the chosen Warframe and 2 additional weapons will appear as buff eligible. \nThe following Warframe Blueprints that can be obtained from Simaris can now be sold for Credits: \nHolding RB on controller now opens the Operator ability menu like it does for Warframes. \nPurchases on the Warframe website and when purchasing TennoGen now use new backend science to determine the currency/region pricing.

A couple key goals of the Focus School System changes in Update 31.5.0 was to bring all Schools to the same level (while keeping their identifying attributes) and bring synergy to Warframe and Operator gameplay. While we believe we’ve achieved that, there’s still very understandable feedback surrounding the “survivability of Operators” in higher level combat (most noticeable in the Zariman gameplay). It’s unfair to put players in scenarios where Operator gameplay is required, but not provide a general base bump to their survivability.\nShield Gating now applies to Operators, giving you a strategic moment to Transfer back to Warframe, recover in Void Mode, or tough it out!\nFixed an unintended extra cooldown going from Operator to Warframe and back, caused by the ‘Opening Slam’ Focus node. \nFixed an incorrect sound being played when Transferring from Warframe to Operator.\nAdjusted how black colors appear on the Warframe Voidshell Skins with certain Material Structures equipped. \nSelecting black for all color slots while using any mix of the Oxium Gloss, Crimzian Opulence, Gleaming Alloy, Smooth Salvage, Titanium Sheen, and Zetki Quality Material Structures caused the Warframe to disappear into nothing but a shadow silhouette and crushing details (could essentially play “Who’s that Warframe”).\nFixed loss of functionality when Client rapidly transfers back to Warframe after getting impaled by Void Manifestation. ",

As the direct narrative follow-up to The New War, there is much to be unearthed in this next chapter. \nNew Warframe: Gyre \nThe Zariman Ten Zero cries out into the endless darkness that surrounds it. In a post-New War world, something lingers in the Void-ridden ship once inhabited by the Tenno. Its wailing can be heard from afar. Return to it, find the source of its song, and unearth the memories echoing throughout the vacant corridors.\nThe Zariman appears in the Star Chart after completing The New War quest, but is only accessible after completing the Angels of the Zariman quest.\nYou may recognize the entrance of your apartment from a pivotal moment in The New War quest. The Dormizone is similar to the Orbiter in that it is your own personal space to customize how you see fit. You can bring your favorite decorations from your Orbiter and outfit this space and give it your own touch.\nVenture into the dark Void of the Zariman with a fully reinforced Arsenal! Unleash electric fury as the newest Warframe, Gyre; unlock a bounty of new Customizations with Voidshell Warframe Skins; and master brand-new Weapons as you bring light to the dark and deadly Zariman.\nGyre Warframe\nThe Ordis Sentinel Skin is available for purchase via the in-game Market if you have completed The New War quest.\nAt its core, Focus aimed to be an exciting new path to enjoy Warframe from the lens of another character. What we’ve come to realize over the many years is that there was a lack of true synergy between Operator and Warframe. We hope to change that while also bringing something fresh to the table!\nFor Operator Gameplay specifically, these changes come in three major ways: first, the introduction of Void Sling; secondly, re-engineering Operators to be Client-authoritative to reduce jank caused by latency issues related to the mission host; thirdly, removal of Void Blast to allow Melee inputs to cause automatic Transference from Operator to Warframe.\nHaving no Melee weapon equipped will result in Transferring to your Warframe holding your Primary/Secondary instead.\nWarframe Melee Finishers can be triggered as Operator with ‘Use’ input near an unaware or stunned enemy, automatically insta-Transferring to Warframe to perform them.\nThe Focus School rework aims to boost the lesser used Schools by a) giving them more interesting and useful abilities, b) defining a clear role and gameplay style for each school, and c) incentivizing Warframe-Operator Transference as part of the core gameplay loop.\n100% Amp Critical Damage for 20s on switching to Operator. 50% Casting Speed on switching to Warframe.\n40% Weapon Efficiency for Operator and Warframe while Void Strike is active.\nSwitching to Warframe after a Chained Sling adds 40% Ability Strength for 20s.\nWhy: Adding the additional Operator Damage allows for benefits for both Warframe and Operator in the name of synergy.\nGain immunity to slow, stagger, and knockdown effects for 40s after Transferring between Operator or Warframe.\nRevive your Warframe by Transferring to Operator and killing enemies before the Revive Meter drains, 15s. Each kill filles the Revive Meter by 30%.\nWarframe is invulnerable for 4s after Operator is downed. Tap X as Operator falls to bring the Warframe to the Operator’s location.\nWhy: Its new coexistence alongside another Focus ability unifies the 2 together to add another layer that benefits both Warframe and Operator. It also removes having to pick up the Unairu Wisp manually, and will instead find you within Affinity Range. \nIncreases Armor for Warframe and Operator by 200.\nWhy: Adding the additional Operator Armor allows for benefits for both Warframe and Operator in the name of synergy.\nPerforming a Slam as Operator switches to Warframe and grants double Combo gain for 20s.\nInitiating a finisher as Operator switches to Warframe, increasing melee Critical chance by 50% for 40s. \nWhen Guardian Shell breaks, Warframe Shield Regeneration rate is increased by 150% and Regeneration Delay is reduced by 90%, for 8s. \nEffect is doubled while controlling your Warframe.\nWhy: Additional benefit between using both Warframe and Operator.\nAdded labels to indicate which abilities affect Warframe and Operator.\nWhile Overguard is active, it will keep Eximus units immune to Warframe crowd control abilities and anything that will stagger, knockdown, stun, mind control, ragdoll, and blind. Additionally, Overguarded enemies will be unaffected by Radiation Status Effects and will be susceptible to a maximum of 4 Cold Status Effects at one time. However, Overguard is particularly susceptible to Void damage (including Xaku’s Xata’s Whisper), which will overall improve the flow and synergy between Warframe and Operator combat flow when engaging with Eximus units. This will encourage you to engage with them more interactively as opposed to easily overpowering them with abilities alone. It should shift the focus of fighting Eximus units to using a mixture of weapons and teamwork, and make Eximus units feel like more of a true threat to Warframes.\nConsidering Eximus enemies are now more formidable, that strength is amplified when encountering Eximus units in a pack. To help counter that in different parts of Warframe we’ve made the following changes: \nWarden Eximus units in Rescue missions have not received these new Eximus upgrades, to ensure they are just as easy to stealthily remove as before.\nAs a follow up to our Necramech Drop Rate & Crafting Cost Changes from Update 30.9.0, we wanted to add another way to set up players for success as they continue their journey to The New War and other content that requires a Necramech to participate. \nRemoved the ‘Craft a Warframe Specter’ from the Europa Junction Task list. \nLike many other areas where you are able to provide a custom message, players can report a Clan ad if it violates any of our Terms of Service, Code of Conduct, or leads to any form of discrimination or harassment of other players. Recruit to your heart’s content, Tenno, but as always we ask that you keep Warframe a welcoming space for all.\nChanged post-New War quest Plains of Eidolon Thumpers to have quest-specific detailing during specific bounties.\nMade optimizations to deleting and saving Warframe loadouts.\nYou can now zoom in and out of your Warframe while customizing their Appearance in the Arsenal! \nSmoothed out the cloth movement sounds on a certain important character in The New War quest that starts with the letter “D”. \nWe have updated certain Warframe abilities to now affect allied NPCs!

        "changes": "Update 31.1.0: Echoes Of War:\nLess than 2 months ago The New War Quest was launched on all platforms. Our ambitions to have Replay on launch didn’t make it in time, but we made it our top priority to have it ready for our first Update of 2022. There’s still no accurate words to describe our appreciation for all the support and reactions to The New War, and we hope you enjoy replaying it as many times as you wish!\nThere’s lots more in the Warframe oven for 2022 \nExperience The New War Quest once more, Tenno! Access The New War Quest in the Codex to Replay. Please note with this implementation the Replay is a full time commitment and you will be locked into the Quest as you were in the first run, so plan accordingly.\nThis quest has significant Spoilers for Warframe and its future. While The New War has been out since December 15th, there are still Tenno out there who have yet to experience it for the first time. Please let all Tenno experience it at their own pace, and be kind. Use liberal spoiler tags if you wish to talk about it, and do not ruin the experience for someone else. Content Creators should clearly label spoiler content and use spoiler-free thumbnails.\nAdditionally, 3 ‘The New War’ Somachord Tones have been added to the post-New War Plains of Eidolon and Orb Vallis. Based on player feedback, we have made these Somachord Tones stationary, meaning they will always be in the same spot (different from the original Orb Vallis Somachord Tones) and require 1 scan each. They’ll remain in their spots after Scanned for helpful Tenno who waypoint them for others!\nIncluded in this first batch of designs from Round 21, you’ll find exciting Skins and Customizations for your Warframes, Weapons, and more! Check them out now via Steam launcher and support hard-working Tenno designers from the Warframe Community.\nOur TennoBaum celebrations look a little different this year! Due to factors including The New War’s December launch, we have opted to merge this year’s TennoBaum & Star Days together in the month of February.\nFestive accessories from TennoBaum 2020 will return as part of Ticker’s Star Days offerings, and the TennoBaum tradition of donating will continue with a donation to a charity (to be announced on February 9) on behalf of the Warframe community. While no in-game gifting event and online tracker will occur this year, we’ll also be taking the spirit of gift-giving into a special TennoBaum x Star Days livestream on February 10th, which will be our Prime Time gifting spectacular!\nWe rebuilt reflections across the entire game when Enhanced Graphics Engine is enabled to use modern high quality texture format which improves the quality and punch of gold, bronze, chrome, and other metallics. This change reduces the noise, makes them more vibrant, and ultimately more balanced overall. A lot to visually enjoy during your replay (or first playthrough!) of The New War!",

And as always: CRANK THAT AUDIO!!\nYou may notice your Operator sounds a bit different while playing The New War Quest. We hope you enjoy the updated Operator voices. Pre and Post-New War Operator voices will be the familiar ones you’re accustomed to.\nAdditionally, a new Accessibility setting has been added titled 'Hold Button for Struggle Action'. This allows you to choose either 'Hold' or 'Tap' when confronted with a struggle context action, where typically mashing of a button would be requested. We recommend that you put this setting to your preference before initiating The New War Quest to ensure you have the best experience. Players can turn this on in the Controls options menu at any time in the quest, just above the Archwing section.\nA significant amount of effort has gone into leveraging new graphics technologies for the levels seen in The New War. For PC players we recommend that you set your Graphics Mode to Enhanced for the full experience, if your computer can handle it! (Display tab under Options). The Playstation 5 and XBOX Series X already use this setting.\n*Caliban's base Blueprint can be found in the Market with his Component Blueprints acquired via new Bounty missions unlocked after the completion of the New War Quest. Caliban’s Prex Card can also be found after completion of The New War Quest at a new location.\nCaliban Component Blueprints can be acquired from Narmer Bounties during daylight hours on the Plains of Eidolon, and Orb Vallis during the Night cycle (Night in Cetus means the Bounty is available in Orb Vallis). Narmer Bounties become available after completing The New War quest.\n**Don’t miss Caliban’s Noble & Agile Animations! Featuring our first male-presenting Warframe with a floating animation!\nA fearsome alternative helmet to give Caliban a look he has not worn since the Old War.\nA new Resource, New Set Mods, a new Amp, and Weapon Blueprints are available in Bounties to those who have completed The New War Quest. This new Resource can also be redeemed for Standing where applicable. \nOnce you have finished the New War Quest, a new post-quest setting is available on the 'Earth' Region in the Star Chart directly. Don't miss it!\nPost New-War, new options are available in the Personal Quarters of your Orbiter.\nPrime Resurgence is our first stab at a larger scale Event to the Vaulting program in lieu of The New War. We’ll have lots to review during and after Prime Resurgence ends to dictate how we move forward!

While their firepower provides an advantage, the time and resource investment required to obtain one has shown to be a deterrent to newer players. As The New War approaches, we aim to alleviate that initial friction and provide an easier path of obtainment.\nArm yourself with these new Warframe Augments for Trinity, Lavos, and Xaku!\nWhen we first introduced Forma years ago, Warframe was a much smaller game. We had fewer weapons, fewer Warframes, and way fewer Mods. As players continue their Forma journey, there’s often discussions on doing a Quality of Life (QOL) pass to the way things work with our favourite Golden Puzzle Piece.\nRight now, using a Forma on a Warframe (or Archwing/Necramech) requires you to start from 0 when it comes to Abilities you can use. Furthermore, you only get the first Rank of your First ability. Take Valkyr for instance. You install a Forma, and you’re back to only casting unranked Rip Line!\nSorties and Arbitrations now allow Mastery Rank 30+ players that have put at least 1 Forma into their Warframe to bypass the \"Rank 30 Warframe\" requirement.\nWarframe Decoration tools are all about customization. We value that quality. The learning curve for new players, however, can be pretty steep. Tools like Surface Snapping and Rotation Axis are ideal for ambitious decorators with particular visions for their Orbiters and Dojos, but they can overwhelm Tenno new to decorating.\nSitting in the Helminth chair with a Warframe you haven’t Subsumed yet will now move that option to the top of the list. ",

This means you can remove details such as any attachments on Ember Pyraxis, Mag Prime, the list goes on and on! In addition, Banshee, Frost and Oberon's default Shoulder Armor can now be equipped on Prime versions of the Warframe.\nThis also fixes a long-standing bug where a Warframe that has no default Shoulders Attachments (let's say, Excalibur) and had nothing equipped there, if you clicked on \"left arm\" then it would auto-select the first shoulder armor in your owned list.\nChanged the sorting of items on the End Of Mission screen to better reflect importance, including Steel Essence, Riven Slivers, Granum Crowns, Built Forma, Orokin Cells, Corrupted Holokeys, built Prime parts, War Hilt, Requiem Ultimatums, Exilus Adapters, Drop Chance Boosters, Scintillant, and built Railjack Components.\nAdjusted Chroma Elemental Ward stat display to be more accurate (uses % display for Health/Shield/Armor/reload/holster buffs).\nPlayers under Mastery Rank 2 will no longer see the ‘Update History’ messages upon login, as this information may be overwhelming as they begin their Warframe journey.",

It is fully colour customizable, has 4 Unique Abilities (like a Warframe) and can be summoned for Transference via the NECRAMECH SUMMON Gear Item for use in ANY Open World! The Necramech Summon Gear Item is awarded upon crafting your first Necramech!\nThese 16 Necramech Mods are a mix of familiar Warframe Mods (Necramech Stretch, Necramech Intensify, Necramech Vitality, etc) as well as new Mod types specifically for the Necramech (Necramech Thrusters, Necramech Blitz, Necramech Refuel, etc).\nCustomize your Warframe’s Abilities at a depth never experienced before in Warframe! Introducing THE HELMINTH.\nyou may only know this room as an infested space that allows you to remove the Helminth Cyst. With the ‘Heart of Deimos’ Update, that’s all changing. The Helminth system enables you to customize your Warframes by infusing new Abilities in place of existing Abilities.\nYou can replace 1 Ability per Warframe.\nEvery Warframe can be Subsumed to permanently provide 1 specific Ability to Helminth.\nthey will stay within a given Warframe as long as you decide you want it!\nSubsuming a Warframe is permanent  \nonly Subsume Warframes you are sure you do not want to play with.

We do not allow the Subsuming of any Prime Warframes, but you can Infuse Abilities on Prime Warframes! Warframes can be Subsumed at any Rank (do not need to be Rank 30).\nInfusion is the process of injecting a Warframe with an Ability \nwhether it be one of Helminth’s own, or another Warframes. Every Warframe can receive 1 Infused ability at a time in any Ability slot (i.e you could place Shock on any of the 4 Ability slots).\nSubsuming is the act of permanently providing a base Warframe into the Helminth’s biology. 1 Warframe can be subsumed every 24 hours.\nThe following table outlines the current Ability a given Warframe will provide on the Subsume action.\nIt was apparent in player feedback and our own play testing that these Infused Warframe Abilities had the potential to be the overwhelming choice; which is not ideal. Instead of changing the Ability outright due to those concerns, we decided to give them slight rules when Infused.\nWarframes that are Subsumed join the Helminth in an eternal bond. They will live on in a Lotus flower that matches the colours of the Subsumed Warframe, as a permanent honor.\nCreated by the community in the Community Created Warframe project from theme to aesthetic to Abilities. Xaku’s concept art was made by community fan artist Eornheit!\nSince XAKU is a community Warframe, we will be doing a concerted second Phase of ability tweaks that is based on feedback on all platforms to ensure there are revisions from the community’s experiences.

The ‘Questions and Answers Chat’ channel is now live to provide new and experienced players a place to seek and provide help in a dedicated and organized way. It will be toggled on by default for all new players entering the game for the first time, while Region Chat will be opt-in and can be enabled from Options. For existing players, your chat settings remain untouched but the Q&A Channel has been enabled on login.\nMany Tenno may wonder what our larger goal is here. We have many motivations for these changes, but one of the strongest is the role Region chat plays our report systems. It may come as no surprise to hear that Region chat is home to the most reports of any channel in Warframe. These reports are reviewed and acted on by the staff here at Digital Extremes, and consequences have always been in place for offensive content. However, some consequences were not strict enough. We are aiming to reset the onboarding experience and chat experience in Warframe by including a new default Q&A channel to provide a dedicated place for players to bring Warframe knowledge to a chatroom in a designated place.\nWe also aim to clean up Region chat for members who like having a place to simply discuss Warframe. Region chat will be opt-in, and Offensive Language reports dealing with hate speech will have enforcement that is not up for appeal. If you find yourself under account restrictions due to Offensive Language, our stance is very clear here: We have no tolerance. https://digitalextremes.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043974052-Code-Of-Conduct-Respect-for-all-in-Warframe\nThe Rank Up FX for Warframes, Weapons, and Companions has been given a refresh!

As reported here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/eawwqg/index_points/\nFixed Conduits in Disruption missions missing collision for Warframes. \nFixed issue with Warframes and Companions sometimes disappearing in the Arsenal. \nFixed entering the Extraction point in any mission deactivating Warframe stealth Abilities and making them visible again.\nFixed being unable to complete the “Avoid the Scanners” portion of the War Within quest if the player uses Archwing afterburners to get ahead of the ship. \nFixed the Warframe Launcher not displaying correctly (portions of the UI would be cropped) on systems with high-DPI and custom scaling settings.\nFixed only Energy values for Warframe Abilities showing changes that Mods apply when viewing a Warframe Mod Link.\nFixed scrolling the mouse wheel while hovering over a Planet in the Star Chart resulting in the Warframe to zoom in improperly.\nFixed players getting stuck on a group of rocks after first encountering the Golden Maw in The War Within Quest. \nFixed map hole in the Golden Maw encounter in The War Within quest, allowing players to yeet out of the map because that golden worn is just too scary. \nFixed walk trail (Burning Step, Frozen Step, Fae Path, etc.) Ephemeras spawning half of the FX when equipped on a Warframe with Wisp’s floating animations. \nFixed the Lacera’s handle not fitting into Warframe’s hand when equipped with the Wisp animation set. \nFixed Riven challenges requiring \"without being afflicted by a status effect\" resetting when the status effect is blocked by immunity from sources such as Nezha’s Warding Halo.\nFixed Ordis' spoken dialogue does not match his transmission during the second Orbiter cutscene in The War Within Quest."

        "changes": "If you watched Devstream #136, the 2019 Player Survey showed us that out of the 27,000+ responses, the Kuva Lich system was the 2019 addition that was enjoyed the least. Many players voiced that the Kuva Lich system got progressively less fun the more time and energy was devoted to it. While finding the line between repetition and progress is one Warframe has struggled with since it’s first day, Liches highlighted some issues we aim to address while walking that line.\nFixed Lich ‘Ruse’ clones displaying the default Excalibur Helmet on their shoulder instead of the same Warframe Helmet as their owner. \nThis fix needs some explanation. First of all, a bit of trivia, Railjack operates at a different scale than the rest of Warframe. Perhaps some of you have seen space-time breaking down in the form of truly enormous cats... The Speed that was being shown in the drydock in your ship Stats was in the wrong scale and gave numbers that were inaccurate.  This also caused the bonus given by your engine, displayed in kilometers-per-hour, to be wrong: an engine might say that it gave an extra 30km per hour, but give far far more than that in the Stats if you did the math to convert.  This has been fixed so that: 1) your Stats now show the correct Speed for Railjack's world scale, and, 2) your engines are rated in meters per second which matches up to the Stats.  While it may look like your ship's Speed stat in the drydock has gone down significantly, please try flying around in missions and see how your ship handles. This only fixes how the UI reports the numbers in your Stats. No change to how fast your ship actually moves is intended, and if your ship doesn't fly at the meters-per-second shown in the Stats then it should be carefully measured and reported as a bug.\nFixed the camera breaking when Warping to another player while in the Archwing Slingshot.",

With the ambitious goal of telling Warframe’s story in a way we had never done before, The Second Dream started it all. The moments you shared with us while playing through the quest is a memory all of us at Digital Extremes will never forget. So we thought… wow, we did it… Can we do it again? And so it was, we burned heaps of midnight oil to launch The War Within and experience the roller coaster of feels with you all over again.\nWitnessing your reaction to THE SACRIFICE teaser we showed at TennoCon last year is an emotion we can’t quite put into words. We’re pretty sure you guys shook the convention center and the internet. So we’re absolutely ecstatic that you can now continue your journey as Tenno in the Warframe universe in this new quest.\nFrom all of us at Digital Extremes, thank you for sharing Warframe with us. This once small but growing studio in London, Ontario couldn’t have done any of this without your extraordinary support, Tenno.\nWe hope that you have enjoyed the ride so far. We look forward to seeing what Warframe has in store for all of us as we look toward the future.\nNow, a foreboding vision leads the Tenno to hunt for a savage Warframe. Will you unmask the truth in this mind-bending new chapter of the cinematic storyline? THE SACRIFICE will bring you closer to uncovering what has fallen into shadow.\nTHE SACRIFICE Quest is available after completing The Second Dream, The War Within, Chains of Harrow and the Apostasy Prologue, and will be available in your Codex upon login. Bring your best Warframe and Operator loadouts to face the challenges that await you in THE SACRIFICE .\nCurrently, we have exactly 131 screens in Warframe that need an artistic pass to the new style. 8 are done and ready to go \nWe have also have 2 free Themes specifically tailored for our visually impaired and color blind Tenno: the “Equinox Theme” (B&W theme) and the “High Contrast Theme”! We’d love to get your feedback on them so that we can increase Warframe’s accessibility:\nWarframes with unique Ability-driven (Exalted) Weapons can now be separately Modded in your Arsenal! This includes the ability to customize their appearance too!\nAdded the ability to auto-rotate your Warframe in the Arsenal (using the Right Trigger) while browsing item grid. \nFollowing what we started in our previous mainline, we’ve made thousands more micro-optimizations to hundreds of scripts, including Warframe Powers, Precepts, Enemy Logic, Weapon Behaviors, Game-Modes, and the UI.",

        "additions": "The Plains of Eidolon is an ancient battlefield where Sentients fought to destroy the Orokin Tower that the Ostrons now call home. The Sentients failed and died, leaving behind an ancient graveyard throughout the Landscape. The towering Spectral Sentients known as Eidolons survived the Old War. Every night they ascend from the waters and wander the Plains in search of what they’ve lost. Small, deadly Sentients appear throughout the Plains and protect the Eidolon. At daybreak, they disappear and wait for night to emerge once more.\nThe Grineer have organized drilling stations and sprawling outposts throughout the Plains to excavate the technology of the Old War. Fight Grineer during the day and clear out their bases, but be fast as these Grineer will call reinforcements when they spot danger. As you venture deeper into the Plains, there will be tougher Grineer enemies so come prepared. When night falls, some Grineer will retreat to their camps and attempt to wait it out while reinforcing their outposts and repairing their equipment for the new day.\nAugur Message (Warframe)\nAugur Accord (Warframe) \nAugur Reach (Warframe) \nAugur Secrets (Warframe) \nVigilante Pursuit (Warframe) \nVigilante Vigor (Warframe) \nGladiator Aegis (Warframe) \nGladiator Resolve (Warframe) \nGladiator Finesse (Warframe) \nWhen night approaches and only the bravest Grineer remain, the Eidolon you seek emerges to roam the Plains. But this towering giant does not seem all to phased with you as a Warframe...\nIt's been almost two years since we released the first version of Focus. Focus comes as a system unlocked upon completion of 'The Second Dream'. After answering a series of questions from The Lotus, you (the Operator) chose a Focus school and began your journey through a series of Passives that you needed to unlock all the while earning the Focus points to do so. Then came The War Within, where your Operator became playable with a few abilities meant mainly to help you earn Kuva and participate in Quests.\nThe core purpose of this rework is to shift the goals of the Focus system away from supplementing Warframes and towards making your Operator more combat-ready. This means that there will be more of a balance between Passives and Actives under Focus 2.0.",
        "changes": "Warframe Update 22: Plains Of Eidolon:\nIf you're new to Warframe \nPlains of Eidolon, with its expansive landscape and all-new dynamic game systems, represents the ongoing evolution of Warframe. Our continuing mission: to create a game that feels alive, that challenges its creators and its players alike. A game that lives up to the amazing community that has grown around it.\nTo create more flow with Transference between Operator and Warframe, you can now seamlessly transition to your Operator and back to your Warframe at any time \nWhen in Operator mode, Warframes now have a 90% damage reduction from enemies if an ability is active during Transference. If no ability is active during Transference, you Warframe is invulnerable and untargetable.\nOne of Warframe’s biggest appeals is the diverse selection of weaponry. Even within the subclasses of rifles and pistols, there is huge variety to be found, such as the distinction between projectile weapons (firing physical projectiles which move through space, like the Boltor) and hitscan weapons (firing draws an imaginary line between the gun and the point aimed at, doing damage instantly to whatever it hits, like the Soma). For obvious reasons, hitscans are very effective at long distances \nthis has never been an issue with Warframe’s tileset-based gameplay, but as we shot enemies from a kilometer away in the plains with our pistols, we knew something had to be done.\nThe in-game Market now includes a separate category for Warframe Deluxe Bundles! \nMade many small performance optimizations to all Warframe abilities.\nChanged Juggernaut's response to Warframe abilities to be consistent with other bosses.",

When The War Within launched, we added Rivens to Sorties as a common drop to be the new, interesting, and unique evergreen goal for players in Sorties.  Rivens remain common with these changes as we see them as the ultimate goal for Sorties. Regarding Nitain specifically, the majority of our recently active players have less than 9 Nitain in their accounts and there is considerable interest in some new ways to acquire, so we are trying out Sorties as an option. A next step here is being considered to add a completely new Ayatan in the place of 2K Endo to give collectors and Endo hunters something to look forward to.",

When traditional developers pen their open letters at launch, it's often the last step after months or years of development. It's often a sign-off to address the people who are about to dive into the finished work of a collective group. But Warframe is far from traditional and our work is never done.\nThe War Within is here on PC! This is the next chapter in the story of Warframe. What we set out to do always seems a little wild in hindsight, but it's the thrill and ambition of storytelling that drives us to challenge ourselves and you. We want to grow and change Warframe in interesting ways. We're presenting you another chapter of growth today.\nThe War Within is also a reflection of lessons for us on how to feed, respect, and tame the growing animal that is Warframe. This update's name has outgrown itself and it represents something bigger. If you asked any of us 4 years ago what we expected to happen with this project, none of us would believe you if you showed us this day.\nWe are beyond lucky to have hard working people at Digital Extremes to bring this chapter of Warframe to life. We are grateful to have you to share it with.\nEver since the change to the new Solar Chart in Specters of the Rail, the Invasion system hasn't exactly been exciting or novel. The War Within brings some much needed freshness to this part of the game!\nSorties were introduced in The Second Dream. They originally launched with 'Seasons' that rotated with set rewards. Since launch we iterated in several ways, including adding repeatable/non-repeatable rewards and more. Now we bring you more change with The War Within: Sortie Seasons are no more. We now have a set reward list of rewards that are always repeatable.\nThe new pre-requisite to access Sorties is completion of The War Within. \nThere is a new addition to Sortie rewards, but this will be revealed upon completion of The War Within.\nChanged \"X Offset\" option to adjust Holster Position to move along to edge of your Warframe.\nAdded \"Z Offset\" option to adjust Holster Position distance from your Warframe.\nVolumetric Lighting technology is here and has been implemented in The War Within quest!\nImproved the overall performance of multiple Warframe ability visual effects.\nWarning lights and sounds will now play upon Raptor NS’ Energy Mortar attack.",

Each unlocked fragment comes with beautiful concept art that can be displayed on your Landing Craft Displays.\nItem linking is a popular pastime in many MMOs, and now you’ll be able to link items in Warframe’s chat by typing “[“ plus the name of the item you wish to link! Clicking the link will open a description of that item. We hope this will also help the [Flow] when trading your [Spare Parts]!\nA Warframe’s active abilities will be deactivated upon entering a Nullifier bubble.\nAbilities that exist independent of their creator will not be deactivated if the Warframe enters a nullifier, but will be destroyed if touched by the bubble itself. For example, Frost’s Snowglobe will not disappear when Frost enters the bubble, but will be destroyed if the bubble comes into contact with the Snowglobe sphere.\nWarframe Helmet blueprints are now labeled as ‘Neuroptics’. Please note that when trading components, full Warframe sets now contain Systems, Chassis, and Neuroptics (previously Helmet) as components.",
        "fixes": "After years of new content releases and updated items to collect, there is a certain irony in calling the Void the “void”. Until Specters of the Rail, getting specific Prime parts was a repetitive and regimented process. Each Tower mission has a corresponding key and reward table, and if you want one of those rewards, you need to stock up on the appropriate key and repeat the same mission until you accomplish your goal. That all changes with the introduction of Relics. Instead of running the same mission repeatedly, Relics allow you to dynamically acquire the rewards you want by playing Fissure missions that appear on any planet, and there will always be Void Fissures active. Collecting cool rewards is a fundamental aspect of Warframe, and this new Void system is designed to make it more fun and immersive \nThis Update brings a huge change to the way our distance and obstruction sound works across all of Warframe. All distant sounds now feel properly spatialized and obstructed sounds now have the feeling of walls and more. Each shot, each character sound, each infested squeal will now bring you a more visceral and deep sound experience.\nThe Warframe Market got a facelift! Two big motivators behind this rework are pretty straight-forward: a) to make it easier to find what you want and to see what’s available; and b) to allow the Market to grow as more content is added in-game. Highlights of this upgrade include better item categories (especially for Cosmetics) and a brand new search function to help you fine-tune your results. A new hide/show owned button will make browsing for new gear a breeze, but for those who need to save up for the big ticket items, the new Wishlist feature will help you keep track of your must-haves. Feeling particularly generous? You can see your friends’ Wishlists and gift them what their heart desires!\nA large majority of Market-related complaints we receive relate to the confusion between built items (aka Platinum-purchased) and Blueprints. The current Market set-up can misguide players into thinking that Warframes, Weapons, and Sentinels aren’t craftable in-game, so we condensed the Built items and Blueprints into the same page. Information about build costs, stats, blueprint location, and more, will be separated into 3 tabs on this page to help players learn all they need to know about the item in order to make an informed purchase!\nFixed missing sounds from many various Warframe idle animations.\nFixed seeing incorrect Warframe Deluxe skins on players who switch Warframe's in the Relay.\nFixed the Tethra's Doom badge clipping through Warframe shoulders.\nFixed the Daikyu quiver clipping into the back of numerous Warframes.\nFixed the FX of Nezha’s Warding Halo applying to nearby allies.\nFixed offsets for Lunaro Riv Set chest armour pieces for several Warframes.\nFixed an issue with Steam Big Pic gamepad bindings being wiped if Warframe was launched outside of Big Pic mode."

Enjoy! :D\nWith Inaros, the sands of old have been swept away from U18 Warframe leaving behind a newer, more vibrant U18.5 Warframe. In many respects, 18.5 is a remastered, more HD version of Warframe with months of technical graphical improvements and artistic relighting of many parts of the game (and more to come in subsequent updates). On top of these changes are across the board rendering performance improvements we hope you'll enjoy, keep in mind that your particular hardware may benefit more and benefit less depending on your GPU, resolution and preferred graphics settings.\nAll PBR materials have been recompressed with a more accurate format, new and subtle details are visible on your PBR'd Warframes, gear and in the environment.             \nWind force modelling on many particle systems increase realism as various environmental particles now respond to explosive forces and Warframe powers – you've also probably seen us showcase this in our most recent Devstream.         \nPhysics collision, performance and stability have all been improved, as a long-awaited upgrade of Warframe PhysX libraries has been completed.\nWard Recovery \nNezha Warding Halo Conclave Augment \nAll Warframes now have an innate 4 second immunity to being staggered or knocked down after being staggered or knocked down in Conclave.\nWarframe Resistance and Immunity Changes\nThe following changes have been made to Warfarme Ability powers when used against boss-type enemies.  These changes do not affect the damage each Ability does as discussed in our Developer Workshop here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/605059-immunity-vs-resistance/\nValkyr’s Warcry now has diminishing returns against boss-type enemies.\nThe Stalker will no longer appear to attack players wearing a Warframe under Rank 10.\nFixed Chroma’s Elemental Ward not functioning when the Cold element is used.\nFixed Alt+F4 allowing players to close Warframe then rejoin a Mission with their revives refreshed.\nFixed an issue enabling players to exceed the Mod capacity of their Warframe.\nFixed Warframes with ‘alternate weapon’ ultimates (i.e. Valkyr, Excalibur, etc) not properly earning Focus when using these Warframe-specific weapons.\nFixed Warframes not properly earning Focus from kills earned from NPC’s summoned by Warframe powers (i.e. Rumblers, Shadows of the Dead, etc).\nFixed the Misa Prime Syandana floating too far off multiple Warframes."
