Bonewidow is our Melee Necramech more focused on survivability and endurance. Exalted Ironbride is not going to match 1:1 with Arquebex, but that doesn’t mean Ironbride (or the rest of her kit) should be overshadowed.

This resulted in your shield being on your chest (not active). However, when you pressed Melee you would do Maiden’s Kiss, and it would cost Energy, instead of the normal Necramech unarmed attack.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Firing Line affecting Companions/Pets.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Firing Line ragdolling you.\nFixed enemy Bonewidow sometimes getting stuck with Ironbride out and being unable to switch back to its gun.\nFixed Bonewidow Melee attacking while using Shield Maiden (Maiden’s Kiss attack) would show Atlas' Landslide ability pop-up text.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Firing Line animation not matching its current shield state correctly. \nFixed Bonewidow’s rear hit box getting hit from front attacks.\nFixed Bonewidow visual-only \"Ability Use Prevented\" problem after toggling Shield Maiden and Ironbride off.\nFixed enemy Bonewidows not knowing how to initiate a Maiden’s Kiss.

Also, with the addition of the new Isolation Vault Bounties, the time it may take squads/solo players to complete them all could exceed the Vome/Fass cycles.\nScintillants have a chance to respawn in Isolation Vault Bounties.\nThe new Isolation Vault Bounties bring you back through the previously completed Vaults and further into the Underground. Having Scintillant respawn grants another kick at the can even if Scintillant was already found in a Vault. \nEsophages in Isolation Vault Bounties now have a press and hold context action to avoid accidentally interacting, and thus having to go all the way back down to do the Vault Generators.\nRebalanced enemy Voidrig (and the upcoming Bonewidow) Isolation Vault fights for a more fair experience that embraces the precedent set with Kuva Liches:\n*Enemy Voidrig & Bonewidow Necramechs now have the ‘Lich’ treatment with vulnerability to Status Effects, meaning you can now apply Status Effects to Necramechs! Additionally, certain damage immunities and diminishing returns for Warframe abilities have been added to balance this out. \nThe damage immunities apply to movement abilities, such as Banshee’s Sonic Boom, to prevent yeeting the Necramech into the sun. The diminishing returns are present to also prevent 1HKOs \nIncreased the cooldown time when the Voidrig (and Bonewidow) cast their invulnerability shield while in their “armless” phase. \nNew Isolation Vault Bounties also have 3 new encounter types within the Bounty!\nThis fearsome Necramech, fashioned in honor of the Entrati matriarch, is a robust front-line fighter. Favoring armor and health over shield strength, Bonewidow can grab and hurl enemies, deploy a heavy shield for personal defense, and cleave through opposing ranks with a massive warblade.\nRaise Bonewidow’s shield to block incoming forward damage.\n*Acquire the Bonewidow Blueprint and the required parts from Loid for Necraloid Standing!\nFind these Necramech Mods as rewards from the new Isolation Vault Bounties or from Loid for Necraloid Standing!\nActualise... synergy...

Previously known as “Splitter,” the clever Mitosid splits in twain to divide and conquer as the Diploid. Both the Basal and Feral Diploid make up for what they lack in maneuverability with what they have in appendages!\nWe’ve increased the Shared Affinity Range in Free Roam missions from 50 meters to 250 meters! When implementing the change to make Necramech’s level up to 40, it prompted the conversation of Necramech leveling and its restriction to Free Roam missions. With the addition of Bonewidow, it felt appropriate to dial the Shared Affinity Range up for these much larger tilesets. While it’s always ideal to stick together, we hope the 250 meter range allows you to both level up your Necramech faster and venture a bit farther in the landscape.\n*Necramechs (Bonewidow and Voidrig) now have a built-in vacuum!\nWith the introduction of the newest Bounties, we reviewed Obelisk spawn sites and saw that they were occupying vacant sites that we felt would be better used for new Bounty objectives! These sites were also difficult for enemies to maneuver and access, and they would often get stuck in the Obelisk shards.\nA version of the Mutalist Cernos Bow, each arrow spawns a swarm of sticky appendages on impact.

Featuring the bile-loaded Catabolyst Pistol, Proboscis Cernos Bow, Pulmonars Nunchaku, and the devastating Bubonico arm cannon.\n‘Radial Attack’ has been renamed to ‘Bounce Attack’. \nMade several minor adjustments to the Bow idle animations to address motion blur issues and more. \nResidual Boils spawns cysts on the ground inside the trigger instead of on the enemy corpse.\nIn addition to written feedback and the poll results, we did a full statistical review of the amount of Steel Essence earned this weekend on both Test and Live, and we are moving forward with the values provided on the Test Cluster: 3 per Steel Essence Incursion Alert, and 2 per Acolyte (eligible for Resource Amount Boosting).\nCodename: Polyp Juggernaut Bounty:\nCodename: Purifier Bounty:\nNecramechs (Bonewidow and Voidrig) now have a built in vacuum!","fixes":"Fixed a rare case of endless Deimos Bounties not giving the bonus Mother Tokens until Round 3. \nFixed a rare case of endless Deimos Bounties using the wrong reward table one stage too early.\nFixed Oxylus’ Botanize scans not costing charges. \nFixed the “Bounty Failed” banner appearing over top of the “Mission Complete” banner for the Host when finishing Bounty and returning to the Necralisk.  \nFixed enemy reinforcements in Cambion Drift Bounties not rushing towards the players / Defense target. \nFixed Bounties auto accepting and not allowing the Client to vote if both players load into any Free Roam mission from the Orbiter. \nFixed Boar reload animation to prevent clipping into the side of the gun.\nFixed animation issues with Ivara/Ivara Prime’s Artemis Bow. \nFixed Operator Sigils disappearing when switching the Bodysuit. \nFixed numerous issues with the Oscira Bow skin. \nFixed the Focus points earned during missions appearing in the End of Mission screen but not the total owned Focus points.

The time has come to continue this work! This batch tackles Warframes from Loki to Rhino (of which there are surprisingly many!). We have increased their viability in missions, which we hope will  encourage more build diversity.\nArmor is a fundamental part of Warframe’s balance, but the act of stripping armor has always been somewhat hard to gauge. Currently, when an armor stripping Ability is cast it uses the target’s current armor as the base for its calculation. This means that you may have to cast that Ability several times on the same enemy in order to strip their armor completely.\nArea of Effect (AoE) weapons are a pretty dominant aspect of Warframe gameplay, especially affected by the removal of self-damage a few years ago. We want AoE weapons to feel impactful, but we feel their current state needs adjustment.\nWarframe is a game full of very powerful tactics, but problems arise when players feel ‘forced’ to use specific choices. The top 5 most popular weapons are all AoE, accounting for 47% of all weapon usage at high Mastery Rank AOE usage stats. In situations where efficiency is important, some would say you aren’t playing ‘correctly’ if you’re not utilizing these choices, which some players don’t necessarily find fun.\nIf you are an experienced Warframe player, you are extremely familiar with the Void Fissure mission flow: Select Relic and blitz through enemies to crack it. It is obvious that where Void Fissure missions are, they are far too easy and can be completed with little to no friction (looking at you Lith). Ultimately, this makes the Prime content not as engaging as it could be, while also leaving new players behind in the dust as the experienced rip through enemies before they can get to them.\nYou can now hold the Transference input to return to your downed Warframe.\nAs mentioned on Devstream #163, we have made changes to the Gilding system to make it easier to access the full power of your Modular items earlier on in-game. For those players that have just completed the Second Dream and are looking to craft a more powerful Amp to help you into and beyond The New War \nThese armor pieces are equippable on both Warframes and Kahl:\nOperator Energy pickups will now be shared with Warframe. \nNote that this won’t affect Warframe mods that trigger certain conditions off energy pick-up while in Operator mode (ie.

It also removes having to pick up the Unairu Wisp manually, and will instead find you within Affinity Range. \nIncreases Armor for Warframe and Operator by 200.\nWhy: Adding the additional Operator Armor allows for benefits for both Warframe and Operator in the name of synergy.\nPerforming a Slam as Operator switches to Warframe and grants double Combo gain for 20s.\nInitiating a finisher as Operator switches to Warframe, increasing melee Critical chance by 50% for 40s. \nWhen Guardian Shell breaks, Warframe Shield Regeneration rate is increased by 150% and Regeneration Delay is reduced by 90%, for 8s. \nEffect is doubled while controlling your Warframe.\nWhy: Additional benefit between using both Warframe and Operator.\nAdded labels to indicate which abilities affect Warframe and Operator.\nWhile Overguard is active, it will keep Eximus units immune to Warframe crowd control abilities and anything that will stagger, knockdown, stun, mind control, ragdoll, and blind. Additionally, Overguarded enemies will be unaffected by Radiation Status Effects and will be susceptible to a maximum of 4 Cold Status Effects at one time. However, Overguard is particularly susceptible to Void damage (including Xaku’s Xata’s Whisper), which will overall improve the flow and synergy between Warframe and Operator combat flow when engaging with Eximus units. This will encourage you to engage with them more interactively as opposed to easily overpowering them with abilities alone. It should shift the focus of fighting Eximus units to using a mixture of weapons and teamwork, and make Eximus units feel like more of a true threat to Warframes.\nConsidering Eximus enemies are now more formidable, that strength is amplified when encountering Eximus units in a pack. To help counter that in different parts of Warframe we’ve made the following changes: \nWarden Eximus units in Rescue missions have not received these new Eximus upgrades, to ensure they are just as easy to stealthily remove as before.\nAs a follow up to our Necramech Drop Rate & Crafting Cost Changes from Update 30.9.0, we wanted to add another way to set up players for success as they continue their journey to The New War and other content that requires a Necramech to participate. \nRemoved the ‘Craft a Warframe Specter’ from the Europa Junction Task list. \nLike many other areas where you are able to provide a custom message, players can report a Clan ad if it violates any of our Terms of Service, Code of Conduct, or leads to any form of discrimination or harassment of other players.

Our ambitions to have Replay on launch didn’t make it in time, but we made it our top priority to have it ready for our first Update of 2022. There’s still no accurate words to describe our appreciation for all the support and reactions to The New War, and we hope you enjoy replaying it as many times as you wish!\nThere’s lots more in the Warframe oven for 2022 \nExperience The New War Quest once more, Tenno! Access The New War Quest in the Codex to Replay. Please note with this implementation the Replay is a full time commitment and you will be locked into the Quest as you were in the first run, so plan accordingly.\nThis quest has significant Spoilers for Warframe and its future. While The New War has been out since December 15th, there are still Tenno out there who have yet to experience it for the first time. Please let all Tenno experience it at their own pace, and be kind. Use liberal spoiler tags if you wish to talk about it, and do not ruin the experience for someone else. Content Creators should clearly label spoiler content and use spoiler-free thumbnails.\nAdditionally, 3 ‘The New War’ Somachord Tones have been added to the post-New War Plains of Eidolon and Orb Vallis. Based on player feedback, we have made these Somachord Tones stationary, meaning they will always be in the same spot (different from the original Orb Vallis Somachord Tones) and require 1 scan each. They’ll remain in their spots after Scanned for helpful Tenno who waypoint them for others!\nIncluded in this first batch of designs from Round 21, you’ll find exciting Skins and Customizations for your Warframes, Weapons, and more! Check them out now via Steam launcher and support hard-working Tenno designers from the Warframe Community.\nOur TennoBaum celebrations look a little different this year! Due to factors including The New War’s December launch, we have opted to merge this year’s TennoBaum & Star Days together in the month of February.\nFestive accessories from TennoBaum 2020 will return as part of Ticker’s Star Days offerings, and the TennoBaum tradition of donating will continue with a donation to a charity (to be announced on February 9) on behalf of the Warframe community. While no in-game gifting event and online tracker will occur this year, we’ll also be taking the spirit of gift-giving into a special TennoBaum x Star Days livestream on February 10th, which will be our Prime Time gifting spectacular!\nWe rebuilt reflections across the entire game when Enhanced Graphics Engine is enabled to use modern high quality texture format which improves the quality and punch of gold, bronze, chrome, and other metallics. This change reduces the noise, makes them more vibrant, and ultimately more balanced overall. A lot to visually enjoy during your replay (or first playthrough!) of The New War!","fixes":"Fixed your Warframe’s orientation quickly changing whenever the Captura Lighting Colour settings are changed.\nThanks to everyone who participated in our Public Test Weekend for New War replay functionality (and possibly first-time Quest runs)!

As players continue their Forma journey, there’s often discussions on doing a Quality of Life (QOL) pass to the way things work with our favourite Golden Puzzle Piece.\nRight now, using a Forma on a Warframe (or Archwing/Necramech) requires you to start from 0 when it comes to Abilities you can use. Furthermore, you only get the first Rank of your First ability. Take Valkyr for instance. You install a Forma, and you’re back to only casting unranked Rip Line!\nSorties and Arbitrations now allow Mastery Rank 30+ players that have put at least 1 Forma into their Warframe to bypass the \"Rank 30 Warframe\" requirement.\nWarframe Decoration tools are all about customization.

It is fully colour customizable, has 4 Unique Abilities (like a Warframe) and can be summoned for Transference via the NECRAMECH SUMMON Gear Item for use in ANY Open World! The Necramech Summon Gear Item is awarded upon crafting your first Necramech!\nThese 16 Necramech Mods are a mix of familiar Warframe Mods (Necramech Stretch, Necramech Intensify, Necramech Vitality, etc) as well as new Mod types specifically for the Necramech (Necramech Thrusters, Necramech Blitz, Necramech Refuel, etc).\nCustomize your Warframe’s Abilities at a depth never experienced before in Warframe!

We do not allow the Subsuming of any Prime Warframes, but you can Infuse Abilities on Prime Warframes! Warframes can be Subsumed at any Rank (do not need to be Rank 30).\nInfusion is the process of injecting a Warframe with an Ability \nwhether it be one of Helminth’s own, or another Warframes. Every Warframe can receive 1 Infused ability at a time in any Ability slot (i.e you could place Shock on any of the 4 Ability slots).\nSubsuming is the act of permanently providing a base Warframe into the Helminth’s biology. 1 Warframe can be subsumed every 24 hours.\nThe following table outlines the current Ability a given Warframe will provide on the Subsume action.\nIt was apparent in player feedback and our own play testing that these Infused Warframe Abilities had the potential to be the overwhelming choice; which is not ideal. Instead of changing the Ability outright due to those concerns, we decided to give them slight rules when Infused.\nWarframes that are Subsumed join the Helminth in an eternal bond.

It will be toggled on by default for all new players entering the game for the first time, while Region Chat will be opt-in and can be enabled from Options. For existing players, your chat settings remain untouched but the Q&A Channel has been enabled on login.\nMany Tenno may wonder what our larger goal is here. We have many motivations for these changes, but one of the strongest is the role Region chat plays our report systems. It may come as no surprise to hear that Region chat is home to the most reports of any channel in Warframe. These reports are reviewed and acted on by the staff here at Digital Extremes, and consequences have always been in place for offensive content. However, some consequences were not strict enough. We are aiming to reset the onboarding experience and chat experience in Warframe by including a new default Q&A channel to provide a dedicated place for players to bring Warframe knowledge to a chatroom in a designated place.\nWe also aim to clean up Region chat for members who like having a place to simply discuss Warframe. Region chat will be opt-in, and Offensive Language reports dealing with hate speech will have enforcement that is not up for appeal. If you find yourself under account restrictions due to Offensive Language, our stance is very clear here: We have no tolerance. https://digitalextremes.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043974052-Code-Of-Conduct-Respect-for-all-in-Warframe\nThe Rank Up FX for Warframes, Weapons, and Companions has been given a refresh!

Instead of having to select “The Quills’ Standing” and then “view offerings”, you now have the option to do so right away. We also updated all mentions of “View Offerings” to “Browse Wares”.\nTrading is an essential part of Warframe and we felt it important to inform players on how to proceed with trading in a safe manner. All players will be presented with the “Trading Policy” window when trading for the first time ever (Mastery Rank 2 players who have just unlocked trading), and for the first time since downloading the update. This applies to any instance of trading in the Dojo and in Maroo’s Bazaar. Once you’ve accepted the Policy you may access it from the “Trading Policy” button when trading if desired. \nNote from the sound team: We've been working on an exciting addition to the master mix of Warframe!

Many players voiced that the Kuva Lich system got progressively less fun the more time and energy was devoted to it. While finding the line between repetition and progress is one Warframe has struggled with since it’s first day, Liches highlighted some issues we aim to address while walking that line.\nFixed Lich ‘Ruse’ clones displaying the default Excalibur Helmet on their shoulder instead of the same Warframe Helmet as their owner. \nThis fix needs some explanation. First of all, a bit of trivia, Railjack operates at a different scale than the rest of Warframe. Perhaps some of you have seen space-time breaking down in the form of truly enormous cats... The Speed that was being shown in the drydock in your ship Stats was in the wrong scale and gave numbers that were inaccurate.  This also caused the bonus given by your engine, displayed in kilometers-per-hour, to be wrong: an engine might say that it gave an extra 30km per hour, but give far far more than that in the Stats if you did the math to convert.  This has been fixed so that: 1) your Stats now show the correct Speed for Railjack's world scale, and, 2) your engines are rated in meters per second which matches up to the Stats.  While it may look like your ship's Speed stat in the drydock has gone down significantly, please try flying around in missions and see how your ship handles. This only fixes how the UI reports the numbers in your Stats. No change to how fast your ship actually moves is intended, and if your ship doesn't fly at the meters-per-second shown in the Stats then it should be carefully measured and reported as a bug.\nFixed the camera breaking when Warping to another player while in the Archwing Slingshot.","fixes":"Fixed fully default Look Links not applying to your Warframe. \nFixed several potential script errors caused by Warframe abilities.\nFixed numerous script errors when casting certain Warframe abilities."},{"name":"Empyrean: Ivara Prime 27.0.12 + 27.0.12.1","date":"2020-01-23T15:36:07Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1163746-empyrean-ivara-prime-27012-270121/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixes towards pathing issues with the Drone in the Plains of Eidolon. This also fixes a very specific spot where the Drone would regularly get stuck.

If a Founding Warlord wishes to be demoted, they must promote another Warlord, thus switching the Roles. If a Clan has a Founder already set (via Support), that person is automatically given the Founding Warlord Role (even if they weren't Warlord), otherwise the Warlord with oldest join date is made Founding Warlord.\nRemoved special Warframe HUDs (Nidus, etc) from being displayed in the Dojo.","fixes":"Warding Halo now only blocks 90% of damage taken. Will still block status effects and other procs.\nFirewalker and Divine Spears offer great area/crowd control, Blazing Chakram offers healing and self-sustain, and his outstanding movement can make the player a hard target to hit. In this context, Warding Halo’s 100% damage resistance was completely overshadowing his other options \nWith 90% damage resistance, Nezha is still very capable of tanking, but encouraged to rely on his other tools to avoid getting overwhelmed. Taking minimal health damage allows for synergy with Blazing Chakram’s health orbs, not to mention new modding avenues like Equilibrium, Health Conversion and various Arcanes. The change also allows us to improve survivability in other ways, such as the increased health pool, and major Warding Halo quality-of-life buffs listed below.\nWhen the health of the Warding Halo runs out, it will do an AoE heat status effect and give you a short period of invulnerability.\nWhy? This gives the player precious time to react, helping survivability while controlling the enemies immediately around you.

With the ambitious goal of telling Warframe’s story in a way we had never done before, The Second Dream started it all. The moments you shared with us while playing through the quest is a memory all of us at Digital Extremes will never forget. So we thought… wow, we did it… Can we do it again? And so it was, we burned heaps of midnight oil to launch The War Within and experience the roller coaster of feels with you all over again.\nWitnessing your reaction to THE SACRIFICE teaser we showed at TennoCon last year is an emotion we can’t quite put into words. We’re pretty sure you guys shook the convention center and the internet. So we’re absolutely ecstatic that you can now continue your journey as Tenno in the Warframe universe in this new quest.\nFrom all of us at Digital Extremes, thank you for sharing Warframe with us. This once small but growing studio in London, Ontario couldn’t have done any of this without your extraordinary support, Tenno.\nWe hope that you have enjoyed the ride so far.

A game that lives up to the amazing community that has grown around it.\nTo create more flow with Transference between Operator and Warframe, you can now seamlessly transition to your Operator and back to your Warframe at any time \nWhen in Operator mode, Warframes now have a 90% damage reduction from enemies if an ability is active during Transference. If no ability is active during Transference, you Warframe is invulnerable and untargetable.\nOne of Warframe’s biggest appeals is the diverse selection of weaponry. Even within the subclasses of rifles and pistols, there is huge variety to be found, such as the distinction between projectile weapons (firing physical projectiles which move through space, like the Boltor) and hitscan weapons (firing draws an imaginary line between the gun and the point aimed at, doing damage instantly to whatever it hits, like the Soma). For obvious reasons, hitscans are very effective at long distances \nthis has never been an issue with Warframe’s tileset-based gameplay, but as we shot enemies from a kilometer away in the plains with our pistols, we knew something had to be done.\nThe in-game Market now includes a separate category for Warframe Deluxe Bundles! \nMade many small performance optimizations to all Warframe abilities.\nChanged Juggernaut's response to Warframe abilities to be consistent with other bosses.","fixes":"Fixed Mozi Syandana not displaying properly on some Warframes and Skins.\nFixed an issue with people being unable to trigger Transference during The War Within.\nFixed an issue in the final cutscene of The Second Dream quest where the Lotus and the Operator would disappear momentarily, giving players the ability to control their Warframe. \nFixed wonky Archwing transitions in the final tileset of The War Within quest.   \nFixed the Igaro Syandana positioning on all Warframes. \nFixed being able to zoom out on your Warframe when hitting ESC upon opening the Star Chart. \nFixed Synthula Alerts appearing in the World State Window before having unlocked the Kuva Fortress via The War Within quest\nFixed Warframe custom HUDs not properly changing if you switch from one Warframe with a custom HUD to another (e.g. Simulacrum arsenal).\nFixed Warframes holding their hand out to the left when jumping along walls to the right.

When traditional developers pen their open letters at launch, it's often the last step after months or years of development.

But Warframe is far from traditional and our work is never done.\nThe War Within is here on PC! This is the next chapter in the story of Warframe. What we set out to do always seems a little wild in hindsight, but it's the thrill and ambition of storytelling that drives us to challenge ourselves and you. We want to grow and change Warframe in interesting ways. We're presenting you another chapter of growth today.\nThe War Within is also a reflection of lessons for us on how to feed, respect, and tame the growing animal that is Warframe. This update's name has outgrown itself and it represents something bigger. If you asked any of us 4 years ago what we expected to happen with this project, none of us would believe you if you showed us this day.\nWe are beyond lucky to have hard working people at Digital Extremes to bring this chapter of Warframe to life.

For example, Frost’s Snowglobe will not disappear when Frost enters the bubble, but will be destroyed if the bubble comes into contact with the Snowglobe sphere.\nWarframe Helmet blueprints are now labeled as ‘Neuroptics’. Please note that when trading components, full Warframe sets now contain Systems, Chassis, and Neuroptics (previously Helmet) as components.","fixes":"After years of new content releases and updated items to collect, there is a certain irony in calling the Void the “void”. Until Specters of the Rail, getting specific Prime parts was a repetitive and regimented process. Each Tower mission has a corresponding key and reward table, and if you want one of those rewards, you need to stock up on the appropriate key and repeat the same mission until you accomplish your goal. That all changes with the introduction of Relics. Instead of running the same mission repeatedly, Relics allow you to dynamically acquire the rewards you want by playing Fissure missions that appear on any planet, and there will always be Void Fissures active. Collecting cool rewards is a fundamental aspect of Warframe, and this new Void system is designed to make it more fun and immersive \nThis Update brings a huge change to the way our distance and obstruction sound works across all of Warframe. All distant sounds now feel properly spatialized and obstructed sounds now have the feeling of walls and more. Each shot, each character sound, each infested squeal will now bring you a more visceral and deep sound experience.\nThe Warframe Market got a facelift! Two big motivators behind this rework are pretty straight-forward: a) to make it easier to find what you want and to see what’s available; and b) to allow the Market to grow as more content is added in-game. Highlights of this upgrade include better item categories (especially for Cosmetics) and a brand new search function to help you fine-tune your results. A new hide/show owned button will make browsing for new gear a breeze, but for those who need to save up for the big ticket items, the new Wishlist feature will help you keep track of your must-haves. Feeling particularly generous? You can see your friends’ Wishlists and gift them what their heart desires!\nA large majority of Market-related complaints we receive relate to the confusion between built items (aka Platinum-purchased) and Blueprints. The current Market set-up can misguide players into thinking that Warframes, Weapons, and Sentinels aren’t craftable in-game, so we condensed the Built items and Blueprints into the same page. Information about build costs, stats, blueprint location, and more, will be separated into 3 tabs on this page to help players learn all they need to know about the item in order to make an informed purchase!\nFixed missing sounds from many various Warframe idle animations.\nFixed seeing incorrect Warframe Deluxe skins on players who switch Warframe's in the Relay.\nFixed the Tethra's Doom badge clipping through Warframe shoulders.\nFixed the Daikyu quiver clipping into the back of numerous Warframes.\nFixed the FX of Nezha’s Warding Halo applying to nearby allies.\nFixed offsets for Lunaro Riv Set chest armour pieces for several Warframes.\nFixed an issue with Steam Big Pic gamepad bindings being wiped if Warframe was launched outside of Big Pic mode."},{"name":"Hotfix: Lunaro 7 + 7.1","date":"2016-06-29T20:32:33Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/665427-hotfix-lunaro-7-71/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed female Grineer Wardens and Eximus’ using male voices."},{"name":"Hotfix: Lunaro 5","date":"2016-06-23T21:11:41Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/663562-hotfix-lunaro-5/","additions":"","changes":"Improved the direction in which your Warframe will perform a dodge roll.","fixes":""},{"name":"Update: Lunaro","date":"2016-06-15T23:58:19Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/660347-update-lunaro/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"•    Fixed Zephyr’s Turbulence not deflecting bullets from hitscan weapons while in mid-air as per https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/4nsj44/bug_turbulence_hitscan_inconsistency_source_found/.\n•    Fixed Hydroid’s abilities causing a delay when attempting to melee or cast another power as per: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/655371-anyone-notice-the-hydroid-nerf/•    Fixed Valkyr’s Hysteria draining twice the amount of Energy as per:  Fixed Valkyr's Hysteria applying efficiency Mods twice as per: https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/4nh5fs/fyi_hysteria_energy_drain_mechanics/"},{"name":"Hotfix 18.13.2","date":"2016-06-01T22:37:51Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/655270-hotfix-18132/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"learning to master many Warframes and Weapons in your Arsenal.
