Let’s breakdown the nutritional facts here: Arquebex is a very high damage weapon for Voidrig, as it makes sense for his damage output kit. Bonewidow is our Melee Necramech more focused on survivability and endurance. Exalted Ironbride is not going to match 1:1 with Arquebex, but that doesn’t mean Ironbride (or the rest of her kit) should be overshadowed. The below aim to address common Community feedback to provide Bonewidow that extra dash of spice.\nRenamed Bonewidow’s Shield Maiden ‘Shield Bash’ to ‘Maiden’s Kiss’.\nReduced Bonewidow’s Maiden’s Kiss to cost 15 Energy.  \nBonewidow’s Meathook thrown enemies now have 100% Status Chance.\nBonewidow’s Meathook now drains a percent of the target's max Health vs flat damage. When the target is thrown the Damage dealt is a percentage of the target's current Health.\nBoth of these changes help to scale Meathook with varying enemy levels.\nBonewidow Necramech can now reflect damage while blocking with Shield Maiden (this is exclusive to the player’s version of Bonewidow).\nBonewidow will now absorb enemy attacks for a few seconds after activating Shield Maiden, and the absorbed damage will be added to the shield’s Health.\nEnemy Bonewidow Shield Maiden now has a limited amount of Health and can be destroyed.\nEnemy Bonewidow will no longer reattach her arm while wielding Exalted Ironbride.

This resulted in your shield being on your chest (not active). However, when you pressed Melee you would do Maiden’s Kiss, and it would cost Energy, instead of the normal Necramech unarmed attack.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Firing Line affecting Companions/Pets.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Firing Line ragdolling you.\nFixed enemy Bonewidow sometimes getting stuck with Ironbride out and being unable to switch back to its gun.\nFixed Bonewidow Melee attacking while using Shield Maiden (Maiden’s Kiss attack) would show Atlas' Landslide ability pop-up text.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Firing Line animation not matching its current shield state correctly. \nFixed Bonewidow’s rear hit box getting hit from front attacks.\nFixed Bonewidow visual-only \"Ability Use Prevented\" problem after toggling Shield Maiden and Ironbride off.\nFixed enemy Bonewidows not knowing how to initiate a Maiden’s Kiss.

As the direct narrative follow-up to The New War, there is much to be unearthed in this next chapter. \nNew Warframe: Gyre \nThe Zariman Ten Zero cries out into the endless darkness that surrounds it. In a post-New War world, something lingers in the Void-ridden ship once inhabited by the Tenno. Its wailing can be heard from afar. Return to it, find the source of its song, and unearth the memories echoing throughout the vacant corridors.\nThe Zariman appears in the Star Chart after completing The New War quest, but is only accessible after completing the Angels of the Zariman quest.\nYou may recognize the entrance of your apartment from a pivotal moment in The New War quest. The Dormizone is similar to the Orbiter in that it is your own personal space to customize how you see fit. You can bring your favorite decorations from your Orbiter and outfit this space and give it your own touch.\nVenture into the dark Void of the Zariman with a fully reinforced Arsenal! Unleash electric fury as the newest Warframe, Gyre; unlock a bounty of new Customizations with Voidshell Warframe Skins; and master brand-new Weapons as you bring light to the dark and deadly Zariman.\nGyre Warframe\nThe Ordis Sentinel Skin is available for purchase via the in-game Market if you have completed The New War quest.\nAt its core, Focus aimed to be an exciting new path to enjoy Warframe from the lens of another character. What we’ve come to realize over the many years is that there was a lack of true synergy between Operator and Warframe. We hope to change that while also bringing something fresh to the table!\nFor Operator Gameplay specifically, these changes come in three major ways: first, the introduction of Void Sling; secondly, re-engineering Operators to be Client-authoritative to reduce jank caused by latency issues related to the mission host; thirdly, removal of Void Blast to allow Melee inputs to cause automatic Transference from Operator to Warframe.\nHaving no Melee weapon equipped will result in Transferring to your Warframe holding your Primary/Secondary instead.\nWarframe Melee Finishers can be triggered as Operator with ‘Use’ input near an unaware or stunned enemy, automatically insta-Transferring to Warframe to perform them.\nThe Focus School rework aims to boost the lesser used Schools by a) giving them more interesting and useful abilities, b) defining a clear role and gameplay style for each school, and c) incentivizing Warframe-Operator Transference as part of the core gameplay loop.\n100% Amp Critical Damage for 20s on switching to Operator. 50% Casting Speed on switching to Warframe.\n40% Weapon Efficiency for Operator and Warframe while Void Strike is active.\nSwitching to Warframe after a Chained Sling adds 40% Ability Strength for 20s.\nWhy: Adding the additional Operator Damage allows for benefits for both Warframe and Operator in the name of synergy.\nGain immunity to slow, stagger, and knockdown effects for 40s after Transferring between Operator or Warframe.\nRevive your Warframe by Transferring to Operator and killing enemies before the Revive Meter drains, 15s. Each kill filles the Revive Meter by 30%.\nWarframe is invulnerable for 4s after Operator is downed. Tap X as Operator falls to bring the Warframe to the Operator’s location.\nWhy: Its new coexistence alongside another Focus ability unifies the 2 together to add another layer that benefits both Warframe and Operator. It also removes having to pick up the Unairu Wisp manually, and will instead find you within Affinity Range. \nIncreases Armor for Warframe and Operator by 200.\nWhy: Adding the additional Operator Armor allows for benefits for both Warframe and Operator in the name of synergy.\nPerforming a Slam as Operator switches to Warframe and grants double Combo gain for 20s.\nInitiating a finisher as Operator switches to Warframe, increasing melee Critical chance by 50% for 40s. \nWhen Guardian Shell breaks, Warframe Shield Regeneration rate is increased by 150% and Regeneration Delay is reduced by 90%, for 8s. \nEffect is doubled while controlling your Warframe.\nWhy: Additional benefit between using both Warframe and Operator.\nAdded labels to indicate which abilities affect Warframe and Operator.\nWhile Overguard is active, it will keep Eximus units immune to Warframe crowd control abilities and anything that will stagger, knockdown, stun, mind control, ragdoll, and blind. Additionally, Overguarded enemies will be unaffected by Radiation Status Effects and will be susceptible to a maximum of 4 Cold Status Effects at one time. However, Overguard is particularly susceptible to Void damage (including Xaku’s Xata’s Whisper), which will overall improve the flow and synergy between Warframe and Operator combat flow when engaging with Eximus units. This will encourage you to engage with them more interactively as opposed to easily overpowering them with abilities alone. It should shift the focus of fighting Eximus units to using a mixture of weapons and teamwork, and make Eximus units feel like more of a true threat to Warframes.\nConsidering Eximus enemies are now more formidable, that strength is amplified when encountering Eximus units in a pack. To help counter that in different parts of Warframe we’ve made the following changes: \nWarden Eximus units in Rescue missions have not received these new Eximus upgrades, to ensure they are just as easy to stealthily remove as before.\nAs a follow up to our Necramech Drop Rate & Crafting Cost Changes from Update 30.9.0, we wanted to add another way to set up players for success as they continue their journey to The New War and other content that requires a Necramech to participate. \nRemoved the ‘Craft a Warframe Specter’ from the Europa Junction Task list. \nLike many other areas where you are able to provide a custom message, players can report a Clan ad if it violates any of our Terms of Service, Code of Conduct, or leads to any form of discrimination or harassment of other players. Recruit to your heart’s content, Tenno, but as always we ask that you keep Warframe a welcoming space for all.\nChanged post-New War quest Plains of Eidolon Thumpers to have quest-specific detailing during specific bounties.\nMade optimizations to deleting and saving Warframe loadouts.\nYou can now zoom in and out of your Warframe while customizing their Appearance in the Arsenal! \nSmoothed out the cloth movement sounds on a certain important character in The New War quest that starts with the letter “D”. \nWe have updated certain Warframe abilities to now affect allied NPCs! In the past, these abilities used to work to varying degrees of effectiveness, we now fixed some lingering issues with each of the abilities and they should be far more effective at assisting these allies in mission. \nChanged the following Warframe Abilities to work on friendly NPCSs (Kavor Defectors,\nMade Sentient red crystal ambient audio in the Murex exclusive to The New War Quest.\nUpdated dialogue timing during Dinner Scene in The New War.\nUpdated statues onboard a Ship during The New War Quest.\nImproved audio syncing in a cinematic in The New War Quest. \nMade updates to Murex floor FX in the New War Quest.\nChanged intervals for pain grunts when taking damage on Spoiler character in the New War. \nMade adjustments to the interior of a Colony Ship in the New War Quest for consistency. ","fixes":"Fixed resources spawning out of reach under the downed Condrix in the post-New War Plains of Eidolon.\nFixed Bounty Drone spawning under terrain in post-New War Plains of Eidolon.\nFixed banner projectile collision during The New War Quest. \nFixed last gem not displaying correct color during ‘On Praghasa’ in The New War Quest. \nFixed flames appearing too far off the ground during Khal’s mission in The New War Quest.\nFixed previewing new skin on a spoiler character after The New War Quest not swapping to previous selection when using controller. \nFixed broken spawn trigger when first using Teshin’s Glaive and traversing gaps during ‘For My Brothers’ in the New War quest.\nFixed unnecessary window flickering in Veso boss arena during The New War Quest.\nFixed bad visual VFX when using the Protovyre Ephemera with a spoiler character in The New War Quest.\nFixed lingering screenshake if you failed to remove the mask during The New War Quest.\nFixed Boss teleport ability using incorrect FX in the New War Quest.\nFixed error with script during a quest fight in The New War that caused issues with Railjack Missions. \nFixed Landing Craft teleporter not transporting when rolling in Post-New War Quest area. \nFixed Client crash related to Post-New War cosmetics when launching a mission in a squad.\nFixed Emblem placement on many Warframes to prevent floating or clipping.\nFixed Operator head flipping in animation during double jump.

Our ambitions to have Replay on launch didn’t make it in time, but we made it our top priority to have it ready for our first Update of 2022. There’s still no accurate words to describe our appreciation for all the support and reactions to The New War, and we hope you enjoy replaying it as many times as you wish!\nThere’s lots more in the Warframe oven for 2022 \nExperience The New War Quest once more, Tenno! Access The New War Quest in the Codex to Replay. Please note with this implementation the Replay is a full time commitment and you will be locked into the Quest as you were in the first run, so plan accordingly.\nThis quest has significant Spoilers for Warframe and its future. While The New War has been out since December 15th, there are still Tenno out there who have yet to experience it for the first time. Please let all Tenno experience it at their own pace, and be kind. Use liberal spoiler tags if you wish to talk about it, and do not ruin the experience for someone else. Content Creators should clearly label spoiler content and use spoiler-free thumbnails.\nAdditionally, 3 ‘The New War’ Somachord Tones have been added to the post-New War Plains of Eidolon and Orb Vallis. Based on player feedback, we have made these Somachord Tones stationary, meaning they will always be in the same spot (different from the original Orb Vallis Somachord Tones) and require 1 scan each. They’ll remain in their spots after Scanned for helpful Tenno who waypoint them for others!\nIncluded in this first batch of designs from Round 21, you’ll find exciting Skins and Customizations for your Warframes, Weapons, and more! Check them out now via Steam launcher and support hard-working Tenno designers from the Warframe Community.\nOur TennoBaum celebrations look a little different this year! Due to factors including The New War’s December launch, we have opted to merge this year’s TennoBaum & Star Days together in the month of February.\nFestive accessories from TennoBaum 2020 will return as part of Ticker’s Star Days offerings, and the TennoBaum tradition of donating will continue with a donation to a charity (to be announced on February 9) on behalf of the Warframe community. While no in-game gifting event and online tracker will occur this year, we’ll also be taking the spirit of gift-giving into a special TennoBaum x Star Days livestream on February 10th, which will be our Prime Time gifting spectacular!\nWe rebuilt reflections across the entire game when Enhanced Graphics Engine is enabled to use modern high quality texture format which improves the quality and punch of gold, bronze, chrome, and other metallics. This change reduces the noise, makes them more vibrant, and ultimately more balanced overall.

While their firepower provides an advantage, the time and resource investment required to obtain one has shown to be a deterrent to newer players. As The New War approaches, we aim to alleviate that initial friction and provide an easier path of obtainment.\nArm yourself with these new Warframe Augments for Trinity, Lavos, and Xaku!\nWhen we first introduced Forma years ago, Warframe was a much smaller game. We had fewer weapons, fewer Warframes, and way fewer Mods. As players continue their Forma journey, there’s often discussions on doing a Quality of Life (QOL) pass to the way things work with our favourite Golden Puzzle Piece.\nRight now, using a Forma on a Warframe (or Archwing/Necramech) requires you to start from 0 when it comes to Abilities you can use. Furthermore, you only get the first Rank of your First ability. Take Valkyr for instance. You install a Forma, and you’re back to only casting unranked Rip Line!\nSorties and Arbitrations now allow Mastery Rank 30+ players that have put at least 1 Forma into their Warframe to bypass the \"Rank 30 Warframe\" requirement.\nWarframe Decoration tools are all about customization. We value that quality. The learning curve for new players, however, can be pretty steep. Tools like Surface Snapping and Rotation Axis are ideal for ambitious decorators with particular visions for their Orbiters and Dojos, but they can overwhelm Tenno new to decorating.\nSitting in the Helminth chair with a Warframe you haven’t Subsumed yet will now move that option to the top of the list. ","fixes":"Coming November 16 for a limited time, we are launching Prime Resurgence!

We did this to connect Railjack to some more ‘core Warframe’ style rewards, and make their acquisition more straightforward for matchmaking purposes.\nEnter Railjack. Technology from the Old War that when wielded today, could take all of Warframe’s combat to Orbit. We tried many things that were different from the norm. While some elements did offer a unique spin on the existing formula, it was not for everybody, and many complaints cited the amount of separation from the main game as a negative. And we agree.

We do not allow the Subsuming of any Prime Warframes, but you can Infuse Abilities on Prime Warframes! Warframes can be Subsumed at any Rank (do not need to be Rank 30).\nInfusion is the process of injecting a Warframe with an Ability \nwhether it be one of Helminth’s own, or another Warframes. Every Warframe can receive 1 Infused ability at a time in any Ability slot (i.e you could place Shock on any of the 4 Ability slots).\nSubsuming is the act of permanently providing a base Warframe into the Helminth’s biology. 1 Warframe can be subsumed every 24 hours.\nThe following table outlines the current Ability a given Warframe will provide on the Subsume action.\nIt was apparent in player feedback and our own play testing that these Infused Warframe Abilities had the potential to be the overwhelming choice; which is not ideal. Instead of changing the Ability outright due to those concerns, we decided to give them slight rules when Infused.\nWarframes that are Subsumed join the Helminth in an eternal bond. They will live on in a Lotus flower that matches the colours of the Subsumed Warframe, as a permanent honor.\nCreated by the community in the Community Created Warframe project from theme to aesthetic to Abilities. Xaku’s concept art was made by community fan artist Eornheit!\nSince XAKU is a community Warframe, we will be doing a concerted second Phase of ability tweaks that is based on feedback on all platforms to ensure there are revisions from the community’s experiences. We will discuss this in a Dev Workshop as we get your feedback on our desks!\nFixed a progression stopping crash in The War Within Quest due to having a Moa Companion equipped.\nFixed a crash when shutting down Warframe while in the Liset Customization screen.\nFixed the Xoris not appearing in your Warframe’s hand when performing a Stealth attack if it’s not the active/equipped weapon.\nFixed numerous script errors when casting certain Warframe Abilities."},{"name":"Derelict Shift: Hotfix 28.3.3","date":"2020-08-13T19:37:14Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1213570-derelict-shift-hotfix-2833/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed the Static Reactor Prime Sigil removing details (including Prime details) when equipped on a Warframe."},{"name":"Derelict Shift: Hotfix 28.3.1","date":"2020-08-12T21:05:11Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1213044-derelict-shift-hotfix-2831/","additions":"","changes":"Disabled some optimizations that may be causing Warframe to crash in some languages.","fixes":""},{"name":"Derelict Shift: Update 28.3.0","date":"2020-08-12T18:34:52Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1212935-derelict-shift-update-2830/","additions":"Since our Dev Workshops in early 2020, we have made a lot of progress behind the scenes on UI updates and changes.

The ‘Questions and Answers Chat’ channel is now live to provide new and experienced players a place to seek and provide help in a dedicated and organized way. It will be toggled on by default for all new players entering the game for the first time, while Region Chat will be opt-in and can be enabled from Options. For existing players, your chat settings remain untouched but the Q&A Channel has been enabled on login.\nMany Tenno may wonder what our larger goal is here. We have many motivations for these changes, but one of the strongest is the role Region chat plays our report systems. It may come as no surprise to hear that Region chat is home to the most reports of any channel in Warframe. These reports are reviewed and acted on by the staff here at Digital Extremes, and consequences have always been in place for offensive content. However, some consequences were not strict enough. We are aiming to reset the onboarding experience and chat experience in Warframe by including a new default Q&A channel to provide a dedicated place for players to bring Warframe knowledge to a chatroom in a designated place.\nWe also aim to clean up Region chat for members who like having a place to simply discuss Warframe. Region chat will be opt-in, and Offensive Language reports dealing with hate speech will have enforcement that is not up for appeal. If you find yourself under account restrictions due to Offensive Language, our stance is very clear here: We have no tolerance. https://digitalextremes.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043974052-Code-Of-Conduct-Respect-for-all-in-Warframe\nThe Rank Up FX for Warframes, Weapons, and Companions has been given a refresh!

While finding the line between repetition and progress is one Warframe has struggled with since it’s first day, Liches highlighted some issues we aim to address while walking that line.\nFixed Lich ‘Ruse’ clones displaying the default Excalibur Helmet on their shoulder instead of the same Warframe Helmet as their owner. \nThis fix needs some explanation. First of all, a bit of trivia, Railjack operates at a different scale than the rest of Warframe. Perhaps some of you have seen space-time breaking down in the form of truly enormous cats... The Speed that was being shown in the drydock in your ship Stats was in the wrong scale and gave numbers that were inaccurate.  This also caused the bonus given by your engine, displayed in kilometers-per-hour, to be wrong: an engine might say that it gave an extra 30km per hour, but give far far more than that in the Stats if you did the math to convert.  This has been fixed so that: 1) your Stats now show the correct Speed for Railjack's world scale, and, 2) your engines are rated in meters per second which matches up to the Stats.  While it may look like your ship's Speed stat in the drydock has gone down significantly, please try flying around in missions and see how your ship handles. This only fixes how the UI reports the numbers in your Stats. No change to how fast your ship actually moves is intended, and if your ship doesn't fly at the meters-per-second shown in the Stats then it should be carefully measured and reported as a bug.\nFixed the camera breaking when Warping to another player while in the Archwing Slingshot.","fixes":"Fixed fully default Look Links not applying to your Warframe. \nFixed several potential script errors caused by Warframe abilities.\nFixed numerous script errors when casting certain Warframe abilities."},{"name":"Empyrean: Ivara Prime 27.0.12 + 27.0.12.1","date":"2020-01-23T15:36:07Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1163746-empyrean-ivara-prime-27012-270121/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixes towards pathing issues with the Drone in the Plains of Eidolon. This also fixes a very specific spot where the Drone would regularly get stuck.

With the ambitious goal of telling Warframe’s story in a way we had never done before, The Second Dream started it all. The moments you shared with us while playing through the quest is a memory all of us at Digital Extremes will never forget. So we thought… wow, we did it… Can we do it again? And so it was, we burned heaps of midnight oil to launch The War Within and experience the roller coaster of feels with you all over again.\nWitnessing your reaction to THE SACRIFICE teaser we showed at TennoCon last year is an emotion we can’t quite put into words. We’re pretty sure you guys shook the convention center and the internet. So we’re absolutely ecstatic that you can now continue your journey as Tenno in the Warframe universe in this new quest.\nFrom all of us at Digital Extremes, thank you for sharing Warframe with us. This once small but growing studio in London, Ontario couldn’t have done any of this without your extraordinary support, Tenno.\nWe hope that you have enjoyed the ride so far. We look forward to seeing what Warframe has in store for all of us as we look toward the future.\nNow, a foreboding vision leads the Tenno to hunt for a savage Warframe. Will you unmask the truth in this mind-bending new chapter of the cinematic storyline? THE SACRIFICE will bring you closer to uncovering what has fallen into shadow.\nTHE SACRIFICE Quest is available after completing The Second Dream, The War Within, Chains of Harrow and the Apostasy Prologue, and will be available in your Codex upon login.
