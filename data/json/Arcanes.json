This reasoning is one of past inconsistency and time determining intent. There are a lot of builds that specialize the use of two Arcanes, but we want to encourage a variety instead of duplication. Arcanes are the only Upgrade system in the game that allows two of the exact same upgrade to be equipped \nand we would rather players have variety than duplications. In the same way you can’t equip Amalgam Serration and regular Serration, you can’t equip multiple Rivens per weapon, or any duplication of Mods at all, Arcanes will follow. But we are making major changes to the Ranking (up from 3 to 5 with power changes). Instead of having 2 of the same Arcane with a double effect, you can now choose between 2 different Arcanes that behave (generally) at 1.5x efficacy than before.\nWhy: The conversation surrounding Arcane Guardian led to a significant review of Armor stats on Warfarmes.

Arcane Revives are a bonus that begins on Rank 3. \nAdjusting the power of Arcanes at Rank 5 to generally behave as if you had 1.5 equipped, list as follows:\nArcane Acceleration:\nArcane Aegis: \nArcane Agility:\nArcane Arachne: \nArcane Avenger:\nArcane Awakening:\nArcane Barrier:\nArcane Blade Charger:\nArcane Bodyguard: \nArcane Consequence:\nArcane Deflection:\nArcane Energize:\nArcane Energize will still give Energy to toggled Warframe Abilities \nArcane Eruption:\nArcane Fury:\nArcane Grace\nArcane Guardian\nArcane Healing\nArcane Ice\nArcane Momentum\nArcane Nullifier\nArcane Phantasm\nArcane Pistoleer\nArcane Precision\nArcane Primary Charger\nArcane Pulse \nArcane Rage\nArcane Resistance\nArcane Strike\nArcane Tanker\nArcane Tempo\nArcane Trickery\nArcane Ultimatum \nArcane Velocity\nArcane Victory\nArcane Warmth\nWhy: The reasoning here is mainly toward the ability to equip two of the same Arcane. This reasoning is one of past inconsistency and time determining intent. There are a lot of builds that specialize the use of two Arcanes, but we want to encourage a variety instead of duplication. Arcanes are the only Upgrade system in the game that allows two of the exact same upgrade to be equipped \nand we would rather players have variety than duplications. In the same way you can’t equip Amalgam Serration and regular Serration, you can’t equip multiple Rivens per weapon, or any duplication of Mods at all, Arcanes will follow. But we are making major changes to the Ranking (up from 3 to 5 with power changes). Instead of having 2 of the same Arcane with a double effect, you can now choose between 2 different Arcanes that behave (generally) at 1.5x efficacy than before.\nWhy: The conversation surrounding Arcane Guardian led to a significant review of Armor stats on Warfarmes. The Majority of Warframes received an increase in the Armor stat to increase survivability. Compounded with Shield Gating and the numerous other changes covered, we expect a much more fair feeling playing field for all Warframes.",

A player using the Kuva Bramma will notice Self Damage is gone. A player with Multishot mods equipped should see some changes in their Upgrade Menus with the addition of a new Multishot Stat.\nFixed missing controller button callout to Rank up an Arcane in the Arcane Manager screen"

In short, there are three stats that each Arcane tends to have (speaking generally) -\nCertain Arcanes increase all of these stats per rank (making them scale exponentially), but we are changing it so that only one stat is affected by rank (making it scale linearly). The other stats will now be at the max-rank value regardless of the Arcane Rank, thereby buffing lower-rank Arcanes as a result.\nFor example, using Arcane Fury.\n*Arcane Barrier is the one true exception to the Arcane changes below, since it has two scaling stats, but one of those stats actually becomes worse with rank. Rank 3-4 for example increases the cooldown from 4s to 5s. So if we were to change it to have constant cooldown like the others, we would be increasing the cooldown duration for the lower ranks \nwhich is something we want to avoid! Any other possible changes might have to alter how the Arcane works overall, so we ultimately decided to leave it untouched.\n*As a bonus for the four Residual Arcanes above, we’ve added some extra improvements \nAdded FX backdrop to equipped Arcanes in the Operator Equipment screen.\nChanged color on Amp Arcanes to all use the same green. \nUpdated Arcane icons back to being square.\nThis is always how the Arcane has functioned, we are simply updating the description.",

In some cases you can clear waves of Elite Sanctuary Onslaught without even using a Warframe or Weapon, and simply spam Magus Lockdown to victory. This goes well beyond the intended use of it and we are changing it to a CC only Arcane \nMagus Lockdown no longer affects the Golden Maw due to the Arcane killing the Maw and preventing Quest completion. \nUpdated the Arcane ‘DISTILL’ term to ‘BREAK DOWN’ to acquaint new Arcane Management mechanics.\nAdded tips to the Arcane screen for ‘BREAK DOWN’, Arcanes that refresh, and how to obtain respective Arcanes. \nArcanes are now displayed with their respective Icon in the HUD, instead of the generic Arcane icon.\nThe Rank-Up callout is now displayed to the left of the next Arcane Rank in the Arcane Upgrade screen when using a controller.\nArcanes that are sold in Vendor Offerings will now only show Max Rank tooltip information, and UI indication that the Arcane you’re purchasing is Unranked. \nThis fixes Arcane tooltips expanding off screen when viewed in Vendor Offerings. \nClarified Arcane requirements for Arcane Trickery, Arcane Ultimatum, and Exodia Might by adding ‘Kill’ to the ‘On Finisher’ line.",

This reasoning is one of past inconsistency and time determining intent. There are a lot of builds that specialize the use of two Arcanes, but we want to encourage a variety instead of duplication. Arcanes are the only Upgrade system in the game that allows two of the exact same upgrade to be equipped \nand we would rather players have variety than duplications. In the same way you can’t equip Amalgam Serration and regular Serration, you can’t equip multiple Rivens per weapon, or any duplication of Mods at all, Arcanes will follow. But we are making major changes to the Ranking (up from 3 to 5 with power changes). Instead of having 2 of the same Arcane with a double effect, you can now choose between 2 different Arcanes that behave (generally) at 1.5x efficacy than before.\nWhy: The conversation surrounding Arcane Guardian led to a significant review of Armor stats on Warfarmes. The Majority of Warframes received an increase in the Armor stat to increase survivability. Compounded with Shield Gating and the numerous other changes covered, we expect a much more fair feeling playing field for all Warframes.",

This reasoning is one of past inconsistency and time determining intent. There are a lot of builds that specialize the use of two Arcanes, but we want to encourage a variety instead of duplication. Arcanes are the only Upgrade system in the game that allows two of the exact same upgrade to be equipped \nand we would rather players have variety than duplications. In the same way you can’t equip Amalgam Serration and regular Serration, you can’t equip multiple Rivens per weapon, or any duplication of Mods at all, Arcanes will follow. But we are making major changes to the Ranking (up from 3 to 5 with power changes). Instead of having 2 of the same Arcane with a double effect, you can now choose between 2 different Arcanes that behave (generally) at 1.5x efficacy than before.\nWhy: The conversation surrounding Arcane Guardian led to a significant review of Armor stats on Warfarmes.

Arcane Revives are a bonus that begins on Rank 3. \nAdjusting the power of Arcanes at Rank 5 to generally behave as if you had 1.5 equipped, list as follows:\nArcane Acceleration:\nArcane Aegis: \nArcane Agility:\nArcane Arachne: \nArcane Avenger:\nArcane Awakening:\nArcane Barrier:\nArcane Blade Charger:\nArcane Bodyguard: \nArcane Consequence:\nArcane Deflection:\nArcane Energize:\nArcane Energize will still give Energy to toggled Warframe Abilities \nArcane Eruption:\nArcane Fury:\nArcane Grace\nArcane Guardian\nArcane Healing\nArcane Ice\nArcane Momentum\nArcane Nullifier\nArcane Phantasm\nArcane Pistoleer\nArcane Precision\nArcane Primary Charger\nArcane Pulse \nArcane Rage\nArcane Resistance\nArcane Strike\nArcane Tanker\nArcane Tempo\nArcane Trickery\nArcane Ultimatum \nArcane Velocity\nArcane Victory\nArcane Warmth\nWhy: The reasoning here is mainly toward the ability to equip two of the same Arcane. This reasoning is one of past inconsistency and time determining intent. There are a lot of builds that specialize the use of two Arcanes, but we want to encourage a variety instead of duplication. Arcanes are the only Upgrade system in the game that allows two of the exact same upgrade to be equipped \nand we would rather players have variety than duplications. In the same way you can’t equip Amalgam Serration and regular Serration, you can’t equip multiple Rivens per weapon, or any duplication of Mods at all, Arcanes will follow. But we are making major changes to the Ranking (up from 3 to 5 with power changes). Instead of having 2 of the same Arcane with a double effect, you can now choose between 2 different Arcanes that behave (generally) at 1.5x efficacy than before.\nWhy: The conversation surrounding Arcane Guardian led to a significant review of Armor stats on Warfarmes. The Majority of Warframes received an increase in the Armor stat to increase survivability. Compounded with Shield Gating and the numerous other changes covered, we expect a much more fair feeling playing field for all Warframes.",

A player with Multishot mods equipped should see some changes in their Upgrade Menus with the addition of a new Multishot Stat.\nFixed missing controller button callout to Rank up an Arcane in the Arcane Manager screen"

In short, there are three stats that each Arcane tends to have (speaking generally) -\nCertain Arcanes increase all of these stats per rank (making them scale exponentially), but we are changing it so that only one stat is affected by rank (making it scale linearly). The other stats will now be at the max-rank value regardless of the Arcane Rank, thereby buffing lower-rank Arcanes as a result.\nFor example, using Arcane Fury.\n*Arcane Barrier is the one true exception to the Arcane changes below, since it has two scaling stats, but one of those stats actually becomes worse with rank. Rank 3-4 for example increases the cooldown from 4s to 5s. So if we were to change it to have constant cooldown like the others, we would be increasing the cooldown duration for the lower ranks \nwhich is something we want to avoid! Any other possible changes might have to alter how the Arcane works overall, so we ultimately decided to leave it untouched.\n*As a bonus for the four Residual Arcanes above, we’ve added some extra improvements \nAdded FX backdrop to equipped Arcanes in the Operator Equipment screen.\nChanged color on Amp Arcanes to all use the same green. \nUpdated Arcane icons back to being square.\nThis is always how the Arcane has functioned, we are simply updating the description.",

This reasoning is one of past inconsistency and time determining intent. There are a lot of builds that specialize the use of two Arcanes, but we want to encourage a variety instead of duplication. Arcanes are the only Upgrade system in the game that allows two of the exact same upgrade to be equipped \nand we would rather players have variety than duplications. In the same way you can’t equip Amalgam Serration and regular Serration, you can’t equip multiple Rivens per weapon, or any duplication of Mods at all, Arcanes will follow. But we are making major changes to the Ranking (up from 3 to 5 with power changes). Instead of having 2 of the same Arcane with a double effect, you can now choose between 2 different Arcanes that behave (generally) at 1.5x efficacy than before.\nWhy: The conversation surrounding Arcane Guardian led to a significant review of Armor stats on Warfarmes.

This reasoning is one of past inconsistency and time determining intent. There are a lot of builds that specialize the use of two Arcanes, but we want to encourage a variety instead of duplication. Arcanes are the only Upgrade system in the game that allows two of the exact same upgrade to be equipped \nand we would rather players have variety than duplications. In the same way you can’t equip Amalgam Serration and regular Serration, you can’t equip multiple Rivens per weapon, or any duplication of Mods at all, Arcanes will follow. But we are making major changes to the Ranking (up from 3 to 5 with power changes). Instead of having 2 of the same Arcane with a double effect, you can now choose between 2 different Arcanes that behave (generally) at 1.5x efficacy than before.\nWhy: The conversation surrounding Arcane Guardian led to a significant review of Armor stats on Warfarmes.

This reasoning is one of past inconsistency and time determining intent. There are a lot of builds that specialize the use of two Arcanes, but we want to encourage a variety instead of duplication. Arcanes are the only Upgrade system in the game that allows two of the exact same upgrade to be equipped \nand we would rather players have variety than duplications. In the same way you can’t equip Amalgam Serration and regular Serration, you can’t equip multiple Rivens per weapon, or any duplication of Mods at all, Arcanes will follow. But we are making major changes to the Ranking (up from 3 to 5 with power changes). Instead of having 2 of the same Arcane with a double effect, you can now choose between 2 different Arcanes that behave (generally) at 1.5x efficacy than before.\nWhy: The conversation surrounding Arcane Guardian led to a significant review of Armor stats on Warfarmes. The Majority of Warframes received an increase in the Armor stat to increase survivability. Compounded with Shield Gating and the numerous other changes covered, we expect a much more fair feeling playing field for all Warframes.",

This reasoning is one of past inconsistency and time determining intent. There are a lot of builds that specialize the use of two Arcanes, but we want to encourage a variety instead of duplication. Arcanes are the only Upgrade system in the game that allows two of the exact same upgrade to be equipped \nand we would rather players have variety than duplications. In the same way you can’t equip Amalgam Serration and regular Serration, you can’t equip multiple Rivens per weapon, or any duplication of Mods at all, Arcanes will follow. But we are making major changes to the Ranking (up from 3 to 5 with power changes). Instead of having 2 of the same Arcane with a double effect, you can now choose between 2 different Arcanes that behave (generally) at 1.5x efficacy than before.\nWhy: The conversation surrounding Arcane Guardian led to a significant review of Armor stats on Warfarmes.

Arcanes are the only Upgrade system in the game that allows two of the exact same upgrade to be equipped \nand we would rather players have variety than duplications. In the same way you can’t equip Amalgam Serration and regular Serration, you can’t equip multiple Rivens per weapon, or any duplication of Mods at all, Arcanes will follow.

Instead of having 2 of the same Arcane with a double effect, you can now choose between 2 different Arcanes that behave (generally) at 1.5x efficacy than before.\nWhy: The conversation surrounding Arcane Guardian led to a significant review of Armor stats on Warfarmes.

Keep in mind that you won’t see all Arcanes in Little Duck's Trade Offerings \nWe are making changes to Magus Lockdown due to it being virtually one of the best CC and Damage combinations in the game. In some cases you can clear waves of Elite Sanctuary Onslaught without even using a Warframe or Weapon, and simply spam Magus Lockdown to victory. This goes well beyond the intended use of it and we are changing it to a CC only Arcane \nMagus Lockdown no longer affects the Golden Maw due to the Arcane killing the Maw and preventing Quest completion. \nUpdated the Arcane ‘DISTILL’ term to ‘BREAK DOWN’ to acquaint new Arcane Management mechanics.\nAdded tips to the Arcane screen for ‘BREAK DOWN’, Arcanes that refresh, and how to obtain respective Arcanes. \nArcanes are now displayed with their respective Icon in the HUD, instead of the generic Arcane icon.\nThe Rank-Up callout is now displayed to the left of the next Arcane Rank in the Arcane Upgrade screen when using a controller.\nArcanes that are sold in Vendor Offerings will now only show Max Rank tooltip information, and UI indication that the Arcane you’re purchasing is Unranked. \nThis fixes Arcane tooltips expanding off screen when viewed in Vendor Offerings. \nClarified Arcane requirements for Arcane Trickery, Arcane Ultimatum, and Exodia Might by adding ‘Kill’ to the ‘On Finisher’ line.",

Arcane Revives are a bonus that begins on Rank 3. \nAdjusting the power of Arcanes at Rank 5 to generally behave as if you had 1.5 equipped, list as follows:\nArcane Acceleration:\nArcane Aegis: \nArcane Agility:\nArcane Arachne: \nArcane Avenger:\nArcane Awakening:\nArcane Barrier:\nArcane Blade Charger:\nArcane Bodyguard: \nArcane Consequence:\nArcane Deflection:\nArcane Energize:\nArcane Energize will still give Energy to toggled Warframe Abilities \nArcane Eruption:\nArcane Fury:\nArcane Grace\nArcane Guardian\nArcane Healing\nArcane Ice\nArcane Momentum\nArcane Nullifier\nArcane Phantasm\nArcane Pistoleer\nArcane Precision\nArcane Primary Charger\nArcane Pulse \nArcane Rage\nArcane Resistance\nArcane Strike\nArcane Tanker\nArcane Tempo\nArcane Trickery\nArcane Ultimatum \nArcane Velocity\nArcane Victory\nArcane Warmth\nWhy: The reasoning here is mainly toward the ability to equip two of the same Arcane. This reasoning is one of past inconsistency and time determining intent. There are a lot of builds that specialize the use of two Arcanes, but we want to encourage a variety instead of duplication. Arcanes are the only Upgrade system in the game that allows two of the exact same upgrade to be equipped \nand we would rather players have variety than duplications. In the same way you can’t equip Amalgam Serration and regular Serration, you can’t equip multiple Rivens per weapon, or any duplication of Mods at all, Arcanes will follow. But we are making major changes to the Ranking (up from 3 to 5 with power changes). Instead of having 2 of the same Arcane with a double effect, you can now choose between 2 different Arcanes that behave (generally) at 1.5x efficacy than before.\nWhy: The conversation surrounding Arcane Guardian led to a significant review of Armor stats on Warfarmes. The Majority of Warframes received an increase in the Armor stat to increase survivability. Compounded with Shield Gating and the numerous other changes covered, we expect a much more fair feeling playing field for all Warframes.",

This reasoning is one of past inconsistency and time determining intent. There are a lot of builds that specialize the use of two Arcanes, but we want to encourage a variety instead of duplication. Arcanes are the only Upgrade system in the game that allows two of the exact same upgrade to be equipped \nand we would rather players have variety than duplications. In the same way you can’t equip Amalgam Serration and regular Serration, you can’t equip multiple Rivens per weapon, or any duplication of Mods at all, Arcanes will follow. But we are making major changes to the Ranking (up from 3 to 5 with power changes). Instead of having 2 of the same Arcane with a double effect, you can now choose between 2 different Arcanes that behave (generally) at 1.5x efficacy than before.\nWhy: The conversation surrounding Arcane Guardian led to a significant review of Armor stats on Warfarmes.

Arcanes are the only Upgrade system in the game that allows two of the exact same upgrade to be equipped \nand we would rather players have variety than duplications. In the same way you can’t equip Amalgam Serration and regular Serration, you can’t equip multiple Rivens per weapon, or any duplication of Mods at all, Arcanes will follow. But we are making major changes to the Ranking (up from 3 to 5 with power changes). Instead of having 2 of the same Arcane with a double effect, you can now choose between 2 different Arcanes that behave (generally) at 1.5x efficacy than before.\nWhy: The conversation surrounding Arcane Guardian led to a significant review of Armor stats on Warfarmes.

Keep in mind that you won’t see all Arcanes in Little Duck's Trade Offerings \nWe are making changes to Magus Lockdown due to it being virtually one of the best CC and Damage combinations in the game. In some cases you can clear waves of Elite Sanctuary Onslaught without even using a Warframe or Weapon, and simply spam Magus Lockdown to victory. This goes well beyond the intended use of it and we are changing it to a CC only Arcane \nMagus Lockdown no longer affects the Golden Maw due to the Arcane killing the Maw and preventing Quest completion. \nUpdated the Arcane ‘DISTILL’ term to ‘BREAK DOWN’ to acquaint new Arcane Management mechanics.\nAdded tips to the Arcane screen for ‘BREAK DOWN’, Arcanes that refresh, and how to obtain respective Arcanes. \nArcanes are now displayed with their respective Icon in the HUD, instead of the generic Arcane icon.\nThe Rank-Up callout is now displayed to the left of the next Arcane Rank in the Arcane Upgrade screen when using a controller.\nArcanes that are sold in Vendor Offerings will now only show Max Rank tooltip information, and UI indication that the Arcane you’re purchasing is Unranked. \nThis fixes Arcane tooltips expanding off screen when viewed in Vendor Offerings. \nClarified Arcane requirements for Arcane Trickery, Arcane Ultimatum, and Exodia Might by adding ‘Kill’ to the ‘On Finisher’ line.",

This reasoning is one of past inconsistency and time determining intent. There are a lot of builds that specialize the use of two Arcanes, but we want to encourage a variety instead of duplication. Arcanes are the only Upgrade system in the game that allows two of the exact same upgrade to be equipped \nand we would rather players have variety than duplications. In the same way you can’t equip Amalgam Serration and regular Serration, you can’t equip multiple Rivens per weapon, or any duplication of Mods at all, Arcanes will follow. But we are making major changes to the Ranking (up from 3 to 5 with power changes). Instead of having 2 of the same Arcane with a double effect, you can now choose between 2 different Arcanes that behave (generally) at 1.5x efficacy than before.\nWhy: The conversation surrounding Arcane Guardian led to a significant review of Armor stats on Warfarmes. The Majority of Warframes received an increase in the Armor stat to increase survivability. Compounded with Shield Gating and the numerous other changes covered, we expect a much more fair feeling playing field for all Warframes.",

This reasoning is one of past inconsistency and time determining intent. There are a lot of builds that specialize the use of two Arcanes, but we want to encourage a variety instead of duplication. Arcanes are the only Upgrade system in the game that allows two of the exact same upgrade to be equipped \nand we would rather players have variety than duplications. In the same way you can’t equip Amalgam Serration and regular Serration, you can’t equip multiple Rivens per weapon, or any duplication of Mods at all, Arcanes will follow. But we are making major changes to the Ranking (up from 3 to 5 with power changes). Instead of having 2 of the same Arcane with a double effect, you can now choose between 2 different Arcanes that behave (generally) at 1.5x efficacy than before.\nWhy: The conversation surrounding Arcane Guardian led to a significant review of Armor stats on Warfarmes.
