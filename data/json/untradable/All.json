You may have noticed the inconsistency in Rifted targets ability to interact with hacking panels. While his Rift-based skillset does offer some unique opportunities for players one major issue discussed within the community has been determining what are the 'rules' Limbo's Riftwalking follows. Keeping this in mind players can expect future updates to contain adjustments to Limbo, enemies, and interactable elements of the environment, to help make playing Limbo a more consistent experience.  We will continue to monitor Limbo's unique interactive mechanic and its effect on gameplay, and will let you know should any other changes be necessary.

As more and more gameplay components rely on pickups, we've addressed this issue as it is commonly discussed by you all."

Keeping this in mind players can expect future updates to contain adjustments to Limbo, enemies, and interactable elements of the environment, to help make playing Limbo a more consistent experience.  We will continue to monitor Limbo's unique interactive mechanic and its effect on gameplay, and will let you know should any other changes be necessary.
