Let’s breakdown the nutritional facts here: Arquebex is a very high damage weapon for Voidrig, as it makes sense for his damage output kit. Bonewidow is our Melee Necramech more focused on survivability and endurance. Exalted Ironbride is not going to match 1:1 with Arquebex, but that doesn’t mean Ironbride (or the rest of her kit) should be overshadowed. The below aim to address common Community feedback to provide Bonewidow that extra dash of spice.\nRenamed Bonewidow’s Shield Maiden ‘Shield Bash’ to ‘Maiden’s Kiss’.\nReduced Bonewidow’s Maiden’s Kiss to cost 15 Energy.  \nBonewidow’s Meathook thrown enemies now have 100% Status Chance.\nBonewidow’s Meathook now drains a percent of the target's max Health vs flat damage. When the target is thrown the Damage dealt is a percentage of the target's current Health.\nBonewidow Necramech can now reflect damage while blocking with Shield Maiden (this is exclusive to the player’s version of Bonewidow).\nBonewidow will now absorb enemy attacks for a few seconds after activating Shield Maiden, and the absorbed damage will be added to the shield’s Health.\nEnemy Bonewidow Shield Maiden now has a limited amount of Health and can be destroyed.\nEnemy Bonewidow will no longer reattach her arm while wielding Exalted Ironbride. One thing at a time! \nRemoved Ammo UI when Bonewidow is wielding Ironbride. \nFixed a crash when using Bonewidow’s Meathook on a Deimos Mitosid.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Shield Maiden not deactivating upon Transferring out/back in. This resulted in your shield being on your chest (not active). However, when you pressed Melee you would do Maiden’s Kiss, and it would cost Energy, instead of the normal Necramech unarmed attack.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Firing Line affecting Companions/Pets.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Firing Line ragdolling you.\nFixed enemy Bonewidow sometimes getting stuck with Ironbride out and being unable to switch back to its gun.\nFixed Bonewidow Melee attacking while using Shield Maiden (Maiden’s Kiss attack) would show Atlas' Landslide ability pop-up text.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Firing Line animation not matching its current shield state correctly. \nFixed Bonewidow’s rear hit box getting hit from front attacks.\nFixed Bonewidow visual-only \"Ability Use Prevented\" problem after toggling Shield Maiden and Ironbride off.\nFixed enemy Bonewidows not knowing how to initiate a Maiden’s Kiss. Pucker up! \nFixed enemy Bonewidows sometimes using incorrect idle animations that would cause their shield to look unequipped when it should be and/or their sword to be held incorrectly.\nFixed enemy Bonewidows periodically playing the Shield Maiden unequip animation during a Melee attack combo.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Shield Maiden not deactivating after redeploying/Transferring in and out but still bashing with Shield instead of normal Melee. This also fixes a related issue where Ironbride would only execute the first attack in its combo chain instead of the full loop. \nFixed an issue with Bonewidow’s Shield Maiden blocking bounds becoming very small when attacked. This was causing Bonewidow to take damage instead of the shield.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Meathook not properly skewering the target if done by a Client player. Previously the ragdoll would appear to float around.\nFixed enemies held by Bonewidow’s Meathook able to cast abilities.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Meathook not displaying \"Not Enough Energy\" UI message.\nFixed enemies on Bonewidows Meathook teleporting to their last known spot instead of just being dropped when activating Shield Maiden at the same time.\nEnemy Necramechs (Voidrig & Bonewidow) will now rotate its body to indicate that it is about to slide towards you. \nFixed cases where both Voidrig and Bonewidow wouldn’t attack with its currently equipped weapon.","fixes":""},{"name":"Deimos: Arcana: Hotfix 29.5.6","date":"2020-12-01T22:31:33Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1238756-deimos-arcana-hotfix-2956/","additions":"","changes":"An important raised issue with Bonewidow is being unable to regenerate Health, as Bonewidow is geared towards the more “tankier” focused Necramech in comparison to Voidrig.

Please note that the “energy beard” on the original Revenant Helmet gets removed when the Mephisto Syandana is equipped due to excessive clipping. One could say we had to clip the beard.\nFor a long time now we’ve had a precedent with a handful of Warframe Skins where the “None” option for Attachments (and sometimes Syandanas) was removed if certain Skins, Primes, etc were equipped. This applied to Warframes such as Ember Prime/Pyraxis Skin, Frost, Mag Prime, Oberon, Volt, etc.\nWe now usher in a new “None” era! All Warframes and Warframe Skins that previously did not have the ‘None’ option will have a “None” Attachment or Syandana option, giving you even MORE customization flexibility. This means you can remove details such as any attachments on Ember Pyraxis, Mag Prime, the list goes on and on!

It’s a hefty read below that we appreciate you taking the time to go through. Before you get started, you can look forward to a friendly in-game Inbox message with a few items from us to you. We know you’ve put a lot of time and resources into some of the things we’re changing (Melee, Vauban, Ember, etc), so please enjoy these free items by logging in before December 31st 11:59PM ET:\nThe damage output and charge speed also scale off of one of Ember’s newest abilities...\nTime for a history lesson! Prior to Update 11.5, Ember’s second ability used to be “Overheat”, offering an aura of heat damage which also protected her from enemy fire. Almost SIX years later, it’s time for this ring of fire to come full circle.\nWhen cast, Ember Immolates herself with protective fire armor. Her current level of self-Immolation is indicated by a unique UI indicator; the higher the heat, the more damage resistance, and the more effective Ember’s other abilities become.\nusing Ember’s Fireball or Inferno causes the meter to build faster. But be warned! If the meter reaches maximum, Ember will “overheat” and Immolation will cost progressively more energy per second the longer you stay in an overheated state. To prevent this from happening, use Fire Blast to expel a portion of your heat meter, or toggle Immolation off to reset meter build.\nWith these changes, players will take a more active role in “bringing the heat” to all that stand in their way, with added protection that encapsulates Ember’s volatile nature.\n*Vauban and Ember have been removed from Conclave in the meantime for balancing.","fixes":""},{"name":"Buried Debts: Hotfix 24.5.6","date":"2019-03-26T20:42:29Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1076435-buried-debts-hotfix-2456/","additions":"","changes":"Ember Prime","fixes":""},{"name":"Buried Debts: Hotfix 24.4.4 + 24.4.4.1","date":"2019-03-11T21:01:34Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1069857-buried-debts-hotfix-2444-24441/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed a script error when casting Ember’s Fire Blast ability."},{"name":"Buried Debts: Update 24.4.0","date":"2019-03-08T02:01:23Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1067397-buried-debts-update-2440/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed incorrect FX color on impact when casting Ember’s Fireball ability."},{"name":"Fortuna: Hotfix 24.0.2","date":"2018-11-09T22:23:12Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1027194-fortuna-hotfix-2402/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Ember’s Fireball ability not applying chosen Energy colors. "},{"name":"Chimera: Update 23.10","date":"2018-10-12T13:56:43Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1016610-chimera-update-2310/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Transferring into Operator causing hold Abilities to continue holding until you Transfer back into your Warframe (e.g. Ember Fireball charge)."},{"name":"Mask of the Revenant: Hotfix 23.9.1","date":"2018-09-27T17:23:26Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1012649-mask-of-the-revenant-hotfix-2391/","additions":"","changes":"Updated theme texture icons for all Warframe Skins/Helmets for Ash, Atlas, Banshee, Chroma, Ember and Equinox.","fixes":""},{"name":"Mask of the Revenant: Hotfix 23.8.2","date":"2018-09-19T14:29:43Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1010324-mask-of-the-revenant-hotfix-2382/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Nezha’s Blazing Chakram being blocked by Gara’s Mass Vitrify or Ember’s Fire Blast abilities."},{"name":"Beasts of the Sanctuary: Hotfix 22.20.7","date":"2018-05-30T19:03:25Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/961879-beasts-of-the-sanctuary-hotfix-22207/","additions":"","changes":"Tweaked the lighting of Ember’s Fireblast ability to reduce visual clutter.","fixes":""},{"name":"Beasts of the Sanctuary: Update 22.20.0","date":"2018-05-17T14:55:31Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/957066-beasts-of-the-sanctuary-update-22200/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed broken reference to skeletal mesh that no longer existed on Ember’s Vermillion skin. "},{"name":"Shrine of the Eidolon: Hotfix 22.17.1 - 22.17.1.1","date":"2018-04-05T18:31:09Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/942090-shrine-of-the-eidolon-hotfix-22171-221711/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Ember’s Fireblast unintentionally melting Lephantis/Hemocyte heads like a popsicle in July when cast directly on top of them. "},{"name":"Shrine of the Eidolon: Hotfix 22.13.3","date":"2018-02-21T20:18:33Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/924885-shrine-of-the-eidolon-hotfix-22133/","additions":"","changes":"Hold-to-Charge Abilities (Ember’s Fireball, Zephyr’s Tail Wind, etc) no longer auto cast when full.

Please note that the “energy beard” on the original Revenant Helmet gets removed when the Mephisto Syandana is equipped due to excessive clipping. One could say we had to clip the beard.\nFor a long time now we’ve had a precedent with a handful of Warframe Skins where the “None” option for Attachments (and sometimes Syandanas) was removed if certain Skins, Primes, etc were equipped.

All Warframes and Warframe Skins that previously did not have the ‘None’ option will have a “None” Attachment or Syandana option, giving you even MORE customization flexibility.

It’s a hefty read below that we appreciate you taking the time to go through. Before you get started, you can look forward to a friendly in-game Inbox message with a few items from us to you.

Prior to Update 11.5, Ember’s second ability used to be “Overheat”, offering an aura of heat damage which also protected her from enemy fire. Almost SIX years later, it’s time for this ring of fire to come full circle.\nWhen cast, Ember Immolates herself with protective fire armor. Her current level of self-Immolation is indicated by a unique UI indicator; the higher the heat, the more damage resistance, and the more effective Ember’s other abilities become.\nusing Ember’s Fireball or Inferno causes the meter to build faster. But be warned! If the meter reaches maximum, Ember will “overheat” and Immolation will cost progressively more energy per second the longer you stay in an overheated state. To prevent this from happening, use Fire Blast to expel a portion of your heat meter, or toggle Immolation off to reset meter build.\nWith these changes, players will take a more active role in “bringing the heat” to all that stand in their way, with added protection that encapsulates Ember’s volatile nature.\n*Vauban and Ember have been removed from Conclave in the meantime for balancing.","fixes":""},{"name":"Buried Debts: Hotfix 24.5.6","date":"2019-03-26T20:42:29Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1076435-buried-debts-hotfix-2456/","additions":"","changes":"Ember Prime","fixes":""},{"name":"Buried Debts: Hotfix 24.4.4 + 24.4.4.1","date":"2019-03-11T21:01:34Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1069857-buried-debts-hotfix-2444-24441/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed a script error when casting Ember’s Fire Blast ability."},{"name":"Buried Debts: Update 24.4.0","date":"2019-03-08T02:01:23Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1067397-buried-debts-update-2440/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed incorrect FX color on impact when casting Ember’s Fireball ability."},{"name":"Fortuna: Hotfix 24.0.2","date":"2018-11-09T22:23:12Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1027194-fortuna-hotfix-2402/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Ember’s Fireball ability not applying chosen Energy colors. "},{"name":"Chimera: Update 23.10","date":"2018-10-12T13:56:43Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1016610-chimera-update-2310/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Transferring into Operator causing hold Abilities to continue holding until you Transfer back into your Warframe (e.g. Ember Fireball charge)."},{"name":"Mask of the Revenant: Hotfix 23.9.1","date":"2018-09-27T17:23:26Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1012649-mask-of-the-revenant-hotfix-2391/","additions":"","changes":"Updated theme texture icons for all Warframe Skins/Helmets for Ash, Atlas, Banshee, Chroma, Ember and Equinox.","fixes":""},{"name":"Mask of the Revenant: Hotfix 23.8.2","date":"2018-09-19T14:29:43Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1010324-mask-of-the-revenant-hotfix-2382/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Nezha’s Blazing Chakram being blocked by Gara’s Mass Vitrify or Ember’s Fire Blast abilities."},{"name":"Beasts of the Sanctuary: Hotfix 22.20.7","date":"2018-05-30T19:03:25Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/961879-beasts-of-the-sanctuary-hotfix-22207/","additions":"","changes":"Tweaked the lighting of Ember’s Fireblast ability to reduce visual clutter.","fixes":""},{"name":"Beasts of the Sanctuary: Update 22.20.0","date":"2018-05-17T14:55:31Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/957066-beasts-of-the-sanctuary-update-22200/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed broken reference to skeletal mesh that no longer existed on Ember’s Vermillion skin. "},{"name":"Shrine of the Eidolon: Hotfix 22.17.1 - 22.17.1.1","date":"2018-04-05T18:31:09Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/942090-shrine-of-the-eidolon-hotfix-22171-221711/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Ember’s Fireblast unintentionally melting Lephantis/Hemocyte heads like a popsicle in July when cast directly on top of them. "},{"name":"Shrine of the Eidolon: Hotfix 22.13.3","date":"2018-02-21T20:18:33Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/924885-shrine-of-the-eidolon-hotfix-22133/","additions":"","changes":"Hold-to-Charge Abilities (Ember’s Fireball, Zephyr’s Tail Wind, etc) no longer auto cast when full.

If the target dies by the hands of Inaros, a sand shadow will spawn to assist him.\nSANDSTORM transforms Inaros into a whirling spiral of sand, gathering nearby pickups and throwing enemies away. Enemies previously marked for devour within its radius will drained of shields and health.\nNew Quest: Sands of Inaros\nA uniquely-styled alternate helmet for Inaros.\nWith Inaros, the sands of old have been swept away from U18 Warframe leaving behind a newer, more vibrant U18.5 Warframe. In many respects, 18.5 is a remastered, more HD version of Warframe with months of technical graphical improvements and artistic relighting of many parts of the game (and more to come in subsequent updates). On top of these changes are across the board rendering performance improvements we hope you'll enjoy, keep in mind that your particular hardware may benefit more and benefit less depending on your GPU, resolution and preferred graphics settings."}],"polarities":["madurai","vazarin","vazarin"],"power":125,"productCategory":"Suits","releaseDate":"2020-07-14","sex":"Male","shield":0,"skipBuildTimePrice":50,"sprint":1.05,"sprintSpeed":1.05,"stamina":3,"tradable":false,"type":"Warframe","uniqueName":"/Lotus/Powersuits/Sandman/InarosPrime","vaultDate":"2022-05-21","vaulted":true,"wikiaThumbnail":"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/warframe/images/2/2a/InarosPrime.png/revision/latest?cb=20200714215940","wikiaUrl":"https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Inaros%2FPrime"},{"abilities":[{"name":"Quiver","description":"Cycle through and shoot one of four tactical arrows.

When his skills are mastered, he becomes an unstoppable force of Rift manipulation. While many have perfected the Limbo, there's been a general sense he needs to be revisited to make the mastering feel more rewarding.\nWith this Update, we have revisited Limbo.  Changes to Limbo include the following:\nWhile in the Rift, Limbo receives a slight Energy regeneration. Additionally, enemies killed in the Rift will grant Limbo 10 Energy.\nLimbo darts in and out of different Planes of existence at no Energy cost. Tapping the roll key (default binding Shift) will shift Limbo between the Rift and Material Plane. Shifting into the Rift leaves behind a tear that, for a brief period of time (5s), Limbo and Allies can use it to enter the Rift. Limbos that enter the Rift through the tear can remain in the Rift as long as they please, unlike Allies who have temporary access.\nSend enemies and Allies within a small radius into or out of the Rift for a period of time. Banish targets must be in the same Plane as Limbo to be affected. For example, Limbo must be in the Material Plane to Banish Material Plane targets to the Rift and vice versa. Banished enemies will take damage when casted and will be knocked down for a brief period of time.\nVoid energy surges through Limbo and into the Rift, charging enemies within it. Charged enemies that cross over to the Material Plane will Banish themselves and nearby enemies back into the Rift. When charged enemies die outside of the Rift, they surge and transfer the charge to nearby enemies.\nThe Rift Torrent Augment Mod will now grant Limbo a damage increase (15/20/25/30%) for every enemy affected by Rift Surge and has had it’s description changed to reflect this.\nLimbo's Cataclysm damage increased in Conclave.","fixes":""},{"name":"Update 19.13.0","date":"2017-03-09T20:40:48Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/771036-update-19130/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Limbo’s Noble stance Bow idle using the wrong animation."},{"name":"The Pacifism Defect: Hotfix 19.12.1+19.12.1.1","date":"2017-03-03T21:09:24Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/768981-the-pacifism-defect-hotfix-19121191211/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed the Hyekka Master being able to hit Limbo in the Rift with her Ignis if there are other enemies around Limbo."},{"name":"The Glast Gambit: Hotfix 19.11.1","date":"2017-02-16T22:53:33Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/763619-the-glast-gambit-hotfix-19111/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed the Limbo Aureolus Helmet not functioning properly with his animations.

When his skills are mastered, he becomes an unstoppable force of Rift manipulation. While many have perfected the Limbo, there's been a general sense he needs to be revisited to make the mastering feel more rewarding.\nWith this Update, we have revisited Limbo.  Changes to Limbo include the following:\nWhile in the Rift, Limbo receives a slight Energy regeneration. Additionally, enemies killed in the Rift will grant Limbo 10 Energy.\nLimbo darts in and out of different Planes of existence at no Energy cost. Tapping the roll key (default binding Shift) will shift Limbo between the Rift and Material Plane. Shifting into the Rift leaves behind a tear that, for a brief period of time (5s), Limbo and Allies can use it to enter the Rift. Limbos that enter the Rift through the tear can remain in the Rift as long as they please, unlike Allies who have temporary access.\nSend enemies and Allies within a small radius into or out of the Rift for a period of time. Banish targets must be in the same Plane as Limbo to be affected. For example, Limbo must be in the Material Plane to Banish Material Plane targets to the Rift and vice versa. Banished enemies will take damage when casted and will be knocked down for a brief period of time.\nVoid energy surges through Limbo and into the Rift, charging enemies within it. Charged enemies that cross over to the Material Plane will Banish themselves and nearby enemies back into the Rift. When charged enemies die outside of the Rift, they surge and transfer the charge to nearby enemies.\nThe Rift Torrent Augment Mod will now grant Limbo a damage increase (15/20/25/30%) for every enemy affected by Rift Surge and has had it’s description changed to reflect this.\nLimbo's Cataclysm damage increased in Conclave.","fixes":""},{"name":"Update 19.13.0","date":"2017-03-09T20:40:48Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/771036-update-19130/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Limbo’s Noble stance Bow idle using the wrong animation."},{"name":"The Pacifism Defect: Hotfix 19.12.1+19.12.1.1","date":"2017-03-03T21:09:24Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/768981-the-pacifism-defect-hotfix-19121191211/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed the Hyekka Master being able to hit Limbo in the Rift with her Ignis if there are other enemies around Limbo."},{"name":"The Glast Gambit: Hotfix 19.11.1","date":"2017-02-16T22:53:33Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/763619-the-glast-gambit-hotfix-19111/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed the Limbo Aureolus Helmet not functioning properly with his animations.

As detailed here! \n A sharp-eyed Tenno noticed a change with Eclipse's damage bonus using our new Enhanced Graphics engine setting, and it turns out Mirage had us all under an illusion. Eclipse changes its effect intensity based on how bright (or dark) your current location is. The game calculates the brightness by considering all the light sources that are affecting you.  The problem... Under the Enhanced Graphics engine, lighting is handled in a different way than the Classic way we've been using for years. So while playing Landscape missions the sunlight was not being included in the intensity. What looked like bright open ground lit by the sun was, as far as the game is concerned internally, gloomy and overcast. This will be fixed such that the Eclipse ability will consider the real-time sunlight under the Enhanced renderer.

As detailed here! \n A sharp-eyed Tenno noticed a change with Eclipse's damage bonus using our new Enhanced Graphics engine setting, and it turns out Mirage had us all under an illusion. Eclipse changes its effect intensity based on how bright (or dark) your current location is. The game calculates the brightness by considering all the light sources that are affecting you.  The problem... Under the Enhanced Graphics engine, lighting is handled in a different way than the Classic way we've been using for years. So while playing Landscape missions the sunlight was not being included in the intensity. What looked like bright open ground lit by the sun was, as far as the game is concerned internally, gloomy and overcast. This will be fixed such that the Eclipse ability will consider the real-time sunlight under the Enhanced renderer.

Specters CANNOT cast the following Abilities: Vauban's Minelayer, Ivara's Zipline, Titania's Razorwing, Nekros’ Desecrate and Shadows of the Dead, Excalibur’s Exalted Blade, Valkyr’s Hysteria, Wukong’s Primal Fury, Cloud Walker, and Defy, Atlas’ Petrify and Tectonics, Limbo's entire kit (save for the damage aspect of Banish), and finally Zephyr’s Dive Bomb. ","fixes":""},{"name":"Plains of Eidolon: Update 22.6.0 + Hotfix 22.6.0.1","date":"2017-12-07T22:05:21Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/891096-plains-of-eidolon-update-2260-hotfix-22601/","additions":"","changes":"Removed blue undertone from Nekros Irkalla’s energy wisps.","fixes":"Fixed Nekros Irkalla showing incorrect FX."},{"name":"Plains of Eidolon: Update 22.3.0","date":"2017-11-15T16:50:55Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/879496-plains-of-eidolon-update-2230/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed an issue with Nekros Deluxe's auxiliary and attachments not working as intended."},{"name":"Plains of Eidolon: Hotfix 22.2.5","date":"2017-11-11T02:19:26Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/877028-plains-of-eidolon-hotfix-2225/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Armor Attachments not showing up on the Nekros Irkalla skin."},{"name":"Plains of Eidolon: Hotfix 22.2.4","date":"2017-11-06T21:33:22Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/874821-plains-of-eidolon-hotfix-2224/","additions":"","changes":"Improved the cloth physics on Nekros’ Irkalla Binds.","fixes":"Fixed Nekros’ Irkalla Binds appearing regardless of having them equipped on Nekros and Nekros Prime. "},{"name":"Plains of Eidolon: Hotfix 22.2.3","date":"2017-11-02T23:10:08Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/872261-plains-of-eidolon-hotfix-2223/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Nekros’ Irkalla chains clipping through his body.\nFixed Nekros’ Irkalla wrist chains floating away.  "},{"name":"Plains of Eidolon: Hotfix 22.2.1","date":"2017-11-01T23:18:24Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/871440-plains-of-eidolon-hotfix-2221/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Nekros Prime arm dangle details appearing when equipped on the Nekros Irkalla Skin. As is standard and precedent for all in-house Deluxe Skins, the override of Prime Details is the intent. "},{"name":"Plains of Eidolon: Update 22.2.0","date":"2017-11-01T20:54:33Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/871334-plains-of-eidolon-update-2220/","additions":"Defy death itself, and crush the living with new Deluxe skins for Nekros and Ember!

When considering Nezha’s revamped kit, he is excellent at mitigating enemy damage \nWith 90% damage resistance, Nezha is still very capable of tanking, but encouraged to rely on his other tools to avoid getting overwhelmed. Taking minimal health damage allows for synergy with Blazing Chakram’s health orbs, not to mention new modding avenues like Equilibrium, Health Conversion and various Arcanes. The change also allows us to improve survivability in other ways, such as the increased health pool, and major Warding Halo quality-of-life buffs listed below.\n(Brief aside: as a Nezha main, I was originally skeptical of the 90% damage resistance change, and I suspect many readers will be skeptical too. However, playing the rework myself quickly changed my mind. The various buffs really outweigh the negatives, making Nezha much more capable in a supporting crowd-controller role. If you doubt just how potent 90% damage resistance can be, try out Gara’s Splinter Storm at 130% or more power strength!)\nOn top of all that, Nezha’s sounds have been remastered, adding new auditory

Adds great team value to Nezha’s kit \nWhy? When considering Nezha’s revamped kit, he is excellent at mitigating enemy damage \nWith 90% damage resistance, Nezha is still very capable of tanking, but encouraged to rely on his other tools to avoid getting overwhelmed. Taking minimal health damage allows for synergy with Blazing Chakram’s health orbs, not to mention new modding avenues like Equilibrium, Health Conversion and various Arcanes. The change also allows us to improve survivability in other ways, such as the increased health pool, and major Warding Halo quality-of-life buffs listed below.\n(Brief aside: as a Nezha main, I was originally skeptical of the 90% damage resistance change, and I suspect many readers will be skeptical too. However, playing the rework myself quickly changed my mind. The various buffs really outweigh the negatives, making Nezha much more capable in a supporting crowd-controller role. If you doubt just how potent 90% damage resistance can be, try out Gara’s Splinter Storm at 130% or more power strength!)\nOn top of all that, Nezha’s sounds have been remastered, adding new auditory cues for important moments, like Blazing Chakrams returning to the player, or Warding Halos running out of health!\nPlayers will receive a HUD icon indicating the Health of a Safeguard Halo they

With the dedicated amount of continued feedback and passionate discussions about Oberon’s changes, the time has come to release another round of changes! Oberon Prime is right around the corner so the spotlight will be on him like never before. The changes below were brought forth from Dev discussions and by you, our devoted Tenno. Our goal has always been to give synergy to Oberon’s abilities, while still giving him a way to fill multiple roles in battle. We hope these further changes do just that.\nRange Mods now apply 75% to Range (distance from Oberon) and 75% to Arc Angle of Hallowed Ground (before was 25% to Range and 75% to Arc before).\nOberon’s Renewal now heals friendly summoned units (IE Nekros’ Shadows of the Dead) at 1/3 the rate but consumes 1/3 the Energy drain for doing so. The change to have Renewal not affect friendly summons was met with varying opinions, and is now further tweaked to meet a happy middle ground. \nOberon’s Renewal Armor buff will be applied to allies anytime they step on Hallowed Ground while Renewal is active on them as opposed to them having to be on Hallowed Ground when Renewal hits them.\nOberon’s Reckoning Armor debuff is now based on the target's base Armor instead of current Armor (meaning no more diminishing returns).","fixes":""},{"name":"Octavia’s Anthem: Update 20.6.0 + 20.6.0.1","date":"2017-05-24T20:42:16Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/800141-octavia%E2%80%99s-anthem-update-2060-20601/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed some animation pops when casting Oberon’s Reckoning."},{"name":"Octavia’s Anthem: Update 20.5.0","date":"2017-05-17T19:16:26Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/797978-octavia%E2%80%99s-anthem-update-2050/","additions":"","changes":"Improved Oberon’s Hallowed Ground ability to go up slopers.","fixes":""},{"name":"Octavia’s Anthem: Hotfix 20.4.4","date":"2017-05-08T21:42:19Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/795023-octavia%E2%80%99s-anthem-hotfix-2044/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Oberon’s Hallowed Ground FX not disappearing after a Host migration.

With the dedicated amount of continued feedback and passionate discussions about Oberon’s changes, the time has come to release another round of changes! Oberon Prime is right around the corner so the spotlight will be on him like never before. The changes below were brought forth from Dev discussions and by you, our devoted Tenno. Our goal has always been to give synergy to Oberon’s abilities, while still giving him a way to fill multiple roles in battle. We hope these further changes do just that.\nRange Mods now apply 75% to Range (distance from Oberon) and 75% to Arc Angle of Hallowed Ground (before was 25% to Range and 75% to Arc before).\nOberon’s Renewal now heals friendly summoned units (IE Nekros’ Shadows of the Dead) at 1/3 the rate but consumes 1/3 the Energy drain for doing so. The change to have Renewal not affect friendly summons was met with varying opinions, and is now further tweaked to meet a happy middle ground. \nOberon’s Renewal Armor buff will be applied to allies anytime they step on Hallowed Ground while Renewal is active on them as opposed to them having to be on Hallowed Ground when Renewal hits them.\nOberon’s Reckoning Armor debuff is now based on the target's base Armor instead of current Armor (meaning no more diminishing returns).","fixes":""},{"name":"Octavia’s Anthem: Update 20.6.0 + 20.6.0.1","date":"2017-05-24T20:42:16Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/800141-octavia%E2%80%99s-anthem-update-2060-20601/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed some animation pops when casting Oberon’s Reckoning."},{"name":"Octavia’s Anthem: Update 20.5.0","date":"2017-05-17T19:16:26Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/797978-octavia%E2%80%99s-anthem-update-2050/","additions":"","changes":"Improved Oberon’s Hallowed Ground ability to go up slopers.","fixes":""},{"name":"Octavia’s Anthem: Hotfix 20.4.4","date":"2017-05-08T21:42:19Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/795023-octavia%E2%80%99s-anthem-hotfix-2044/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Oberon’s Hallowed Ground FX not disappearing after a Host migration.

This is also in the interest of using Rare Resources found on earlier planets to allow for Rhino to be crafted earlier on! ","fixes":""},{"name":"Banshee Prime: Hotfix 19.11.5 + 19.11.6","date":"2017-02-28T22:44:49Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/767736-banshee-prime-hotfix-19115-19116/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Clients being able to toggle off Rhino’s Iron Skin with Iron Shrapnel immediately after casting."},{"name":"The Glast Gambit: Hotfix 19.11.4","date":"2017-02-22T15:44:39Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/765827-the-glast-gambit-hotfix-19114/","additions":"","changes":"Rhino’s Roar buff HUD indicator now displays added damage buff amount (it shows up briefly up top just like Trinity’s Blessing %).","fixes":""},{"name":"The Glast Gambit: Hotfix 19.9.2 (Phase One: DB Upgrades)","date":"2017-02-07T13:58:54Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/759911-the-glast-gambit-hotfix-1992-phase-one-db-upgrades/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed a script error when casting Rhino’s Rhino Charge."},{"name":"Update 19: The War Within","date":"2016-11-12T04:02:28Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/715768-update-19-the-war-within/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed some enemies being able to apply a Status Effect through invulnerability abilities such as Rhino’s Iron Skin and Nezha’s Warding Halo."},{"name":"Recurring Dreams: Hotfix 3","date":"2016-11-07T19:24:15Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/714548-recurring-dreams-hotfix-3/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed a script error when casting Rhino’s Charge ability."},{"name":"The Index Preview: Hotfix #4","date":"2016-10-25T21:51:26Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/710966-the-index-preview-hotfix-4/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Clients being unable to hack lock down panels after using numerous Rhino abilities in a row before attempting to hack."},{"name":"The Index Preview: Hotfix #3","date":"2016-10-21T21:33:05Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/709998-the-index-preview-hotfix-3/","additions":"","changes":"Smoothed out frame-time spikes from Rhino Stomp; when surrounded by a lot of enemies it could end up adding 3-4ms on a very fast PC (this occurred once when cast and once to apply time-dilation). ","fixes":"Fixed Nyx’ Chaos and Rhino’s Iron Skin causing a script error upon cast. "},{"name":"The Index Preview","date":"2016-10-20T23:28:18Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/709665-the-index-preview/","additions":"","changes":"Conclave Arsenal now has Ability descriptions specific to Conclave for the following Frames: Ash, Banshee, Hydroid, Inaros, Ivara, Loki, Mag, Mesa, Nekros, Nezha, Nova, Nyx, Rhino, Saryn, Titania, Valkyr, Vauban and Volt.\nDecreased decay delay and increased decay rate of Rhino’s Iron Skin in Conclave.\nOptimized Rhino’s Stomp ability to help alleviate performance issues. ","fixes":""},{"name":"The Silver Grove: U1.2 + U1.3","date":"2016-09-02T18:01:23Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/695536-the-silver-grove-u12-u13/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Chargers and Zanuka remaining permanently frozen after Rhino’s Rhino Stomp ability."},{"name":"The Silver Grove","date":"2016-08-19T17:32:55Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/688644-the-silver-grove/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Rhino being able to activate his heavy landing Passive on all ground slams."},{"name":"Specters of the Rail: Hotfix 4","date":"2016-07-11T21:59:04Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/671654-specters-of-the-rail-hotfix-4/","additions":"","changes":"Rebalanced the Rhino Specter in the Junction to be more manageable for new players.","fixes":""},{"name":"Update 18.11.0 & 18.11.1","date":"2016-05-11T20:30:34Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/647209-update-18110-18111/","additions":"","changes":"•    Improved Rhino Prime’s Iron Skin to appear more metallic.","fixes":""},{"name":"Hotfix 18.10.6","date":"2016-05-06T21:23:23Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/645736-hotfix-18106/","additions":"","changes":"•    Rhino Prime’s Iron Skin will now reflect your chosen accent color instead of energy color.","fixes":""},{"name":"Hotfix 18.10.5","date":"2016-05-04T21:33:02Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/645092-hotfix-18105/","additions":"•    Rhino Prime’s Iron Skin has received the PBR treatment!

However this has a few side effects that impact the game as a whole. First, with more damage, the time to kill on enemies is lowered and the value of Crowd Control declines even more (Vauban?!).

For some people the answer is don't nerf things, buff everything else. This is the path of least resistance for us, as most of the player base is happy when we buff, and angry when we nerf. However this has a few side effects that impact the game as a whole. First, with more damage, the time to kill on enemies is lowered and the value of Crowd Control declines even more (Vauban?!). Higher max damage also means that players with the latest bells and whistles can easily kill bosses in an instant, and overcome any challenge with ease.

It should shift the focus of fighting Eximus units to using a mixture of weapons and teamwork, and make Eximus units feel like more of a true threat to Warframes.\nXaku’s The Lost\nEnemies that are not affected by CC can now be armor stripped by Banshee’s Sonic Boom, Xaku’s Gaze, and Ember’s Fire Blast. ","fixes":"Xaku's Xata's Whisper"},{"name":"Update 31.1.0: Echoes of War","date":"2022-02-09T15:59:43Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1299619-update-3110-echoes-of-war/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed enemies held by Xaku’s Gaze attempting to attack friendly units (Specters, Crewmates, or other players' companions). "},{"name":"Update 31: The New War","date":"2021-12-15T14:23:13Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1290487-update-31-the-new-war/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Disarming an enemy who is held by Xaku Gaze, Loki Radial Disarm, Baruuk Desolate Hands & Serene Storm, Naramon Disarming Blast, Mag Magnetized Discharge Augment, or Kubrow Neutralize results in them counting as a required kill for mission progress."},{"name":"Update 30.9.0: Prime Resurgence","date":"2021-11-11T13:33:32Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1286070-update-3090-prime-resurgence/","additions":"Lavos, Sevagoth, Xaku, Yareli, Baruuk, Gauss, Hildryn, Wisp, Protea and Grendel are now available and can be used in Frame Fighter once their Fragments have been found/Scanned.","changes":"Arm yourself with these new Warframe Augments for Trinity, Lavos, and Xaku!\nWhen a stolen weapon deals damage to an enemy affected by The Lost: Gaze or The Vast Untime, Xaku heals by 25.\nFixed a gap between the casting animation with Xaku’s Gaze and freezing the target, which allowed them to die before they were affected by Gaze. \nFixed Xaku’s Grasp of Lohk weapons having glitchy animations.","fixes":""},{"name":"Nidus Prime & Plague Star: Hotfix 30.7.6","date":"2021-09-23T20:34:00Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1281923-nidus-prime-plague-star-hotfix-3076/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed a broken Text String for Xaku’s Blueprint information in the Market."},{"name":"Nidus Prime & Plague Star: Hotfix 30.7.5","date":"2021-09-16T20:15:52Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1281196-nidus-prime-plague-star-hotfix-3075/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Xaku, Titania and Gara not having a Blueprint hint button in the Market. "},{"name":"Sisters of Parvos: Hotfix 30.5.3","date":"2021-07-09T15:07:34Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1270868-sisters-of-parvos-hotfix-3053%C2%A0%C2%A0/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed a script error related to the Simulacrum and Xaku. "},{"name":"Sisters of Parvos: Hotfix 30.5.2","date":"2021-07-07T20:26:51Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1270347-sisters-of-parvos-hotfix-3052/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed inability to release a target from Xaku’s Gaze if you don't have Energy."},{"name":"Gara Prime: Hotfix 30.3.5","date":"2021-06-10T19:47:41Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1267287-gara-prime-hotfix-3035/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Tyro Battalyst's disarm behavior;
